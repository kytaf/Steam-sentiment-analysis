/*
The following CSS variables define the main, public API for styling JupyterLab.
These variables should be used by all plugins wherever possible. In other
words, plugins should not define custom colors, sizes, etc unless absolutely
necessary. This enables users to change the visual theme of JupyterLab
by changing these variables.

Many variables appear in an ordered sequence (0,1,2,3). These sequences
are designed to work well together, so for example, `--jp-border-color1` should
be used with `--jp-layout-color1`. The numbers have the following meanings:

* 0: super-primary, reserved for special emphasis
* 1: primary, most important under normal situations
* 2: secondary, next most important under normal situations
* 3: tertiary, next most important under normal situations

Throughout JupyterLab, we are mostly following principles from Google's
Material Design when selecting colors. We are not, however, following
all of MD as it is not optimized for dense, information rich UIs.

<pre> Honest review after 40 hours
compound: 0.5106, neg: 0.0, neu: 0.548, pos: 0.452, 
After 20 days, I can safely say.  This game did not meet its promises  at all.  This feels rushed.  This doesn&#39;t feel Mafia. This doesn&#39;t feel like the third sequel we&#39;re waiting for.  This feels like &#39;one man army badass takes over county&#39; style. And trust me, its literally that.  I saved up a few months of money just to get this, and i&#39;m in EXTREME Regret. (Note, Exagherrated really badly.)  Please, don&#39;t let your wallet cry that its money was spent on this.  k real review ♥♥♥♥ed up so rip. also missions are repetitive, go kill this guy, wait for leader, EH.  only reason im doing it is cus of le storyline

It took me almost 23h but I finished it. Here&#39;s what I think about it after beating it.  Pros: - Really cool atmosphere of 60s. Huge detailed city and great soundtrack add to it quite a bit. - Solid story with great characters and awesome voice acting. - Solid game mechanics - shooting, driving, cover system, etc - all works well, but there&#39;s nothing really new about them.  Cons: - My biggest gripe with it - it doesn&#39;t make you feel like you are mafia - AI is pretty much brain dead. Especially if you are using stealth approach. - Repetitive samey side-quests that are forced onto you as gates to main quests - Poor optimisation (performance-wise this game sucks on most machines, even after a bunch of patches) - Little variety of cars and guns - Lots of things hidden behind unlocks that are too boring to achieve (wanna get that rocket launcher? be ready to do more side quests, if you are not sick from them yet!) - Game has a bunch of pretty meaningless unlocks, instead of giving you fun stuff (e.g. unlock to steal cars quietly, that comes after an ability to call in car delivery) - No fast travel - and since city is big, be ready to spend quite some time traveling around  And in general, the game feels as if they didn&#39;t have enough time to finish the game properly. If they&#39;d allow only doing story missions (the most fun part) and beating the game in ~6h or so - it&#39;d be so much better in my opinion.  Unfortunately, now you have to fight those boring gate-quests to get to fun stuff. Which is.. well, not fun. I definitely wouldn&#39;t recommend buying it at full price. Maybe once it&#39;s heavily discounted.  See more detailed explanation of all points (along with some gameplay) in the video:  https://youtu.be/S1Q84XeixcM

I&#39;ve updated the review after finally beated the game. Just in case, I&#39;ll say it. This is my review and nothing but my opinion. Feel free to agree or disagree as long as you respect it.    The bad. Part 1. 30fps never dies.

[May contain spoilers!] Mafia III is an open world crime game set in the year 1968. You play as Lincoln Clay, a Vietnam war veteran out for revenge for the killing and betrayal of his family. I don&#39;t write many reviews but I felt like I needed to let people know what&#39;s up with this game, without talking about graphics.   The World

First and foremost, let me be clear, I have been a massive fan of the Mafia series ever since the first installment, it was amazing and the realism/immersion was incredible with the speed limit, indicators, fuel, stuff like that, so you can understand I was VERY excited when I heard about this game.  Now, lets skip forward to just a few days ago when I finally got the game I was so eager to play... to say I was disappointed would be an understatement. I am VERY unhappy with how Hangar 13 has failed in keeping up with the quality and attention to detail we came to love in Mafia 2.  I also apologise if my review is &#39;TL:DR&#39; but details are important in a review. The following are the reasons why I don&#39;t recommend Mafia 3.  1: No fuel. The Fuel system in the previous Mafia games added a level of immersion that we hadn&#39;t seen before, it was what made it different from other similar games.  2: No speed limit. Previous Mafia games had an enforced speed limit, if the cops saw you going too fast they came after you lights and all, but in Mafia 3 you can buzz past the police as fast as you want and they won&#39;t even bat an eyelid.  3: No Indicators. This isn&#39;t a HUGE feature but it added immersion and that is very important in a game like Mafia. Previous Mafia games you used the indicator by holding left or right while in a vehicle, but none of that in Mafia 3.  4: Graphic issues. You will frequently see that the transition from day to night is VERY quick, sometimes its instant you just see it go from dark to light in seconds. The skybox at sunset and dawn is U.G.L.Y, it just looks horrible.  5: Car Flipping. Just like in GTA if your car rolls over you can just roll it back over and drive off, in the previous Mafia games you could not do that, you had to get a new car which is FAR better and much MUCH more immersive.  6: Combat. In Mafia 3 it feels as if you are fighting the same fight over and over again, much of the buildings are simply copy/pasted and it gets very boring. Especially when all you have to do is hide, whistle and stab, thats it.  7: Weather. Mafia 3 has no real weather. Yes it rains, but thats it, either rain or sun, no snow, no ice, no fog, nothing, I understand its New Orleans but it still snows in New Orleans. Especially when it comes to driving, Mafia 2 has snow and ice and that affected how your car handled, even NPC&#39;s slipped and fell over on the ice.  There are plenty other small things that made the previous Mafia games so much better than Mafia 3.  Such as, shooting hub caps, repairing engines, customising car in garage, random NPC, actual MAFIA not this Haitian bullsh*t, Can&#39;t interact with phonebooths, Police are nerfed in Mafia 3, No car wash, Can&#39;t use car trunk and finally NO BLOODY FOOTPRINTS!! (You also can&#39;t interact with the small things like sinks, toilets, lights, fridges and windows like you could in the previous games).  So I think I have made my point, Mafia 3 is NOT a Mafia game. Yes it has the name and the same devs, but I refuse to believe THIS heap of sh*t is what they had in mind after all these years.

Well, I have been reading through most reviews, positives and negatives and none of them seems to match my fellings about this game, so I decided to write one myself. I&#39;ll List pros, cons and neutrals and give my conclusions at the end of the review. Maybe its just luck but I haven&#39;t experienced a single CTD and only very few fps drops (After the fps patch they seem to become more common, but still manageable) and one small freeze.  I&#39;ll update the review at each new patch or fix released.  Pros: + Catching story and interesting historical setting + Good voice acting and facial animations. + Great atmosphere and city. Makes you feel inside the game and the historical context + AMAZING soundtrack. 60&#39;s rock, blues, jazz and country all the way fitting perfectly with the overrall setting. + Interesting characters, rich dialogues and the plot seems consistent so far even if sometimes its feels rushed. + Impressive lightining effects even though there still some bugs and some people that dislike it. + Cinematic narrative. It feels like you are watching a documentary about your character life and impact on New Bordeaux crime scene.  Neutrals: . Driving Mechanic. I personally like it, as it seems like real driving but I guess a lot of people will not think like me. . Somewhat strange animations. (Getting into or out of cover, Lincoln running with a gun and pedestrians animations are particularly weird.) . A not-so-free world. Even though you can just hang around the city without any specific objective there isnt much to do outside the missions and collectables (It seems there will be patches to fix this, wich reinforces my final conclusion) . Racket System gets repetitive too soon. . Cluttered UI. I can go past it, but it&#39;s really annoying sometimes. . Textures are not high-ended and polished as one could expect from a 2016 AAA game but it doesn&#39;t mean they are ugly!  Cons: - Grainy and often foggy graphics. (The fps patch released on 10/08 adress this, it looks much better now but still an issue) - Step back from Mafia I and II. Shops, bars, clubs are useless even though they are marked on the map, policemen dont care if you are driving 120mph, cargoes dont get damaged etc. These small bits of realism that made the Mafia series unique are absent. - Very restricted field of view (remember GTA 3 and VC? That the map loading was so slow that you could go to someplace before it was even loaded?) (10/09 Update: Fps update adress this as well, it looks reasonable now) - Notable graphic quality drop from cutscenes to actual gameplay.  - FPS lock (30 fps in 2016? Seriously?!) (Even if now there is a patch for that it still a HUGE flaw for a pc game coming out with a 30fps lock) - Bizarre night and day cycle. There&#39;s no in-game clock (at least I haven&#39;t seem one) and day/night cycles looks totally random for me. - Bizarre control scheme (Why not use GTA scheme?) (I play on a controller btw, things seem shitier for keyboard users) - Very Dumb AI. Enemies and NPC&#39;s both. - Overral feeling that you are a playing a BETA and not a finished game. Especially because the next patches will bring things that should already be in the game (as outfit changing, street races, interactive shops etc)  Conclusions:  1) Mafia III is a consistent game with a lot of potencial. Maybe even GOTY potencial, but this pc release is the worst since Arkham Knight (maybe even messier than that one). It seems to me the game was about 80% finished at release date but they released it all the way. Maybe with the coming patches and fixes Mafia III comes up and fulfill all its potencial. So far I can&#39;t reccommend this game to anyone and my veredict is that Hangar 13 and 2K just went lazy after the good pre-release sales. Actually I would give it a 6/10 but it has potencial to hit as high as 9/10 or higher.  2) This game doesn&#39;t seem to fit the Mafia franchise. Dont get me wrong, Mafia III is a potencially awesome game, but it just seems to me that it doesnt fit the franchise at all! The tiny little details that made Mafia an unique and awesome series are lost. Mafia III feels more like a mix of GTA general idea with Shadow of Mordor mechanics and the complex LA Noire history than one of the Mafia games. And the change of perspective (though I can understand it as Lincoln Clay is perfect for the setting proposed) still bites me.  3) DONT PRE-PURCHASE!!! Pre-purchasing ANYTHING is just plain dumb. You are giving away your money in exchange for the promise of a product and NOT for the product itself. This is destructive to any kind of industry as the quality tends to drop as the profitability of that product is already guaranteed before the product even exists. And in my humble opinion this is exactly what happened with Mafia III. A game that was released rushedly and unfinished, with no concern to customer satisfaction as a healthy profit was already safe and sound way before the release date.

As much as I wanted to like it, I simply cant. The starting story (the first 20 ish minutes of the game was the best parts, and for 15 of those minutes it&#39;s a cutescene and for the other 5 you&#39;re in a bank). The story dies off and is followed up by repetitive gameplay doing the same thing over and over again but with different looking enemies.  Step 1: Deal damage.  Step 2: Kill officers. Step 3: Kill distict bosses. Step 4: Make higher ups angry and then kill them (also they spawn in the same place, not even a new area).  Step 5: Repeat steps 1-4 about 6 or more times and then call it a game.  Also it&#39;s great when the vehicles and ai glitch making it lag and having explosions everywhere. The ai of this game invented drifing 100% All in all not worth $60 in the slightest. More around $30 ish. Just play dishonered 1 or 2. They are much better.

I was super hyped for this game after the second game and I didn&#39;t mind the awful graphics and the 30fps lock. I could see past the fact that my 970 couldn&#39;t make it to 60FPS but the fact your game is so buggy that I cannot start the final mission after restarting the game twice is just ridiculous for 2016.   It is disappointing to have to give this game the thumbs down due to it&#39;s lack of story and very very repetitive missions after you finish Sammy&#39;s missions. It is locked at 30fps and you can unlock it to unlimited but I can&#39;t get a stable 60fps with a GTX 970 and the graphics definitely are not impressive enough to demand such a high spec. The game has almost no customization options unlike the previous titles and you can only unlock certain cars. It is the biggest disappointment of 2016 for me and the developers should be ashamed of releasing a product in this state. If I try and complete the mission &#39;My Name is Lincoln Clay&#39; I can no longer progress in the game and it appears to be bugged.   I&#39;ll give an example of how repetitive the game is  Mission 1  - Meet Associate 1 - Destroy building for Associate 1 - Kill Enforcer for Associate 1 - Kill District leader and give control to Associate 1  Mission 2  - Meet Associate 2 - Destroy Store, Truck, Building for Associate 2 - Kill Enforcer for Associate 2 - Kill District leader and give control to Associate 2  Mission 3  - Meet Associate 3 - Small Story Cutscene - Small Story Mission  - Small Story Cutscene  Once you have done this and completed all missions for the associates you will be forced to do it again for the entire game because it never changes and they have absolutely 0 creativity in mission design. All of the story missions feel like side missions. The side missions are more interesting than the main story missions.  As a Mafia game it&#39;s the worst in the series for me but as a standalone game it&#39;s good but not worth full price so I&#39;d say wait for a sale.  This game is the biggest disappointment for me in 2016.

There&#39;s not a single good thing that I can say about this game.  The story is supposed to be good but it just isn&#39;t! An orphan came back from the war and fights racist criminals who killed his homies. That&#39;s it. That their story. I don&#39;t know about you, but I didn&#39;t expect this lackluster from a Mafia title. And the developers have told the story and shown most of the cutscenes on their youtube channel anyway. Gameplay is unbelievably repetitive, everything feels the same, like running in circles. Or rather walking very slowly. There&#39;s usually just a single animation for each action and it gets very annoying watching it over and over and over and over and over and over ... again. Driving cars is not enjoyable in this game and you&#39;ll be driving a lot. I was quite disappointed that there&#39;s no cockpit view. I mean we&#39;ve seen it in promo videos how Clay switches the gears and tunes his radio but there&#39;s none on that in the game. Also you cannot customize cars thought you could in a previous game. NPCs react unrealistically to hero&#39;s actions. I broke into a closed empty club at night and there was just one girl dancing non-stop paying no attention what-so-ever to me until I shot her. Bystanders run straight towards the player to call the police and enemies can&#39;t see Clay right in front of them in stealth. Graphics are insultingly bad. Textures are a blurry mess, sky is the worst I&#39;ve seen in any game. It can turn bright orange in the middle of the night and it changes in such a weird way that you question the state of mind of programmers responsible for that all the time. How did they manage that game looks worse than games from ten years ago is beyond me. Soundtrack which I&#39;ve already heard in a hundred other Vietnam themed games and movies is great. But it was created half a century ago by people that have nothing to do with Hangar 13. And last but not least. The centerfold girls are the same ones that were in the previous game... It&#39;s not that costly to do a new photo shoot of girls in 60s interiors. Overall game feels like a lazy cash grab. I&#39;m very disappointed.

Mediocre throughout.  Incredibly repetitive Very bad AI The more fleshed out, &#39;end of chapter&#39; missions are underwhelming. Locations and concept is excellent, execution in terms of mission design and gameplay seems rushed or cut for most missions. It feels like cool stuff was planned to happen in many of the story missions, but then due to time or other constraints, they had to cut them and replace them with the same, boring, uninspiring shooting that happens throughout the game Story isn&#39;t that good as reviews make it out to be, I think most of them just try to sound balanced and piggyback on the story to have some pros to mention as well.  Excellent facial animations, soundtrack, sound design in general and environment/level design.   Whole load of bugs and some of the dumbest keybinds I&#39;ve yet to see in PC games (some of them corrected with a patch that came out 2 days after the game was launched)  Shame, it&#39;s like they built a cool world to explore, but then filled it with 50+ hours of the most boring and buggy content imaginable.  Hope they learn from this mess and build a great Mafia IV.  4/10. RIP

I have here writing my first review of any game on Steam, and I have to say, I am a huge fans of the Mafia series since 2002 the Mafia: City of Lost Heaven.  This, this Mafia 3, is very very dissapointing. I try to avoid mentioning the graphical side of things.  Pros: -Bigger map, unique settings. -A lot enterable building assets. -Slightly more stuff to do in between story mission; collectables etc.  Cons: -Boring revenge story, every player know exact how its going to be with little to no surprise. -Gameplay graphics differ to cutscene graphics, it tricke dme to believe the game is really that good in the first hour of the game. -Low resolution texture, on Par with Mafia 2 which is years ago. -Extremely repetitive, same side/main story, same way to take over some places throughout the game. -The AI is stupid, a single silenced pistol can takout the whole place and the AI wouldn&#39;t even notice. -Minor physics clipping problem -Character animation is lacking; e.g. Flipped cars and character just magically pops out.  This game feels like a major backwards compare to the prevous two. The Mafia stuff were almost non-existent, the character face animation is great but it doesn&#39;t makeup the lackluster story.  If you really like the Mafia series or have spare money to spend, you can consider buying this game.  Otherwise, you should wait for discount sales or avoid this game.  Edit (9 Oct):  After seeing some video compare Mafia 3 to 2 and 1, I have to add this part in.  In Mafia 1,  -You can ride the tram -You can deform you car using a single bat -When you break the car glasses and the glass remains on the floor -The bullet sheels were visible on the ground -You can refill at the gas station -The police actually catches you but not kill you  In Mafia 2, -You can fix your broken car -You can freely customise you car -You can change clothes as you wish -You can close the god damn door -Tons of minor detail include you can flush the toilet and turn off the light -You can see yourself in the mirror -You can open the hood and trunk -When the glass brakes you can see them have physics -Blood trail after walked over a dead body -You can actually have a fight with people -You have to work the door to steal a car -The police will arrest you instead of killing you -You can bride the police -You have extra activity to do in the game like buy food and clean your shoes  None of them were in Mafia 3.   Edit 2 (10 Oct): Contains Spoilers  Now that I have beaten the game, the story are really no surprise, and same as what the devs told you. Your goal is to kill Sal Marcano and guess what? you did kill him and that&#39;s the end of the game. You can continue to play tha game but there are nothing left to do.   -You can go collect all the remaining collectables i.e. Playboys, Hot Rods and keep wiring stuff. -You can keep robing people -You can... er.... drive around in the city  And that&#39;s about it.  Also you can start over again if you wanted to.    vvvvvv Possible Spoilers vvvvvv     Well actually you have a few choices for the ending,  1: Leave the city after Sal&#39;s dead. 2: Rule the citywith your underbosses. 3: Rule the city alone which kills all your underbosses in a cutscene only.  The biggest difference are the ending scene which the speachs of Father James and the other detactive were different.      ^^^^^^^^ Possible Spoilers ^^^^^^^^    Would love to see more improvements and add more details to the game. I couldn&#39;t even let Clay go to bed or sit or eat, how could he possibly survive?

My Thoughts after 6-7 hours:  Wonderful writing, a great soundtrack, well done atmosphere and great voice work are brought down by tons of technical issues, underwhelming graphics, repetitive missions, balance issues and breain-dead AI. Not the worst game ever, but not close to the best either, some aspects are improved over mafia 2, but many design decisions makes me scratch my head. I am starting to feel bored with the gameplay and mainly only playing more to see how the wonderful story/cut scenes play out.  Once the open world stuff opens up, it gets really repetitive which is a shame as the story is interesting and the atmosphere is great. I honestly wish they would just keep it linear and focused on the story not so much side quests, like Mafia 1/2, Sleeping Dogs and LA Noire did. Play to you&#39;re strong suit, which is story and linear missions! Mafia 3 Could have used more time in the oven so to speak. The first 3/4 hours the game seems like it will be great, but doing this same stuff over and over again for taking over these bases, gets very boring.  I went back and forth between positive or negative review, as my opinion on the game has been so up and down. I just hope the story stuff continues to be good for the whole game, I will add more to this review when I finish the game, the thumbs down could turn to thumbs up, but the bad aspects of this game really are a shame as some aspects are very well done, just not a very well rounded product. Also what is up with the skybox and the rain effects? They look ps1 or snes quality.   If I had to score it right now it would be a 6/10, it does some stuff so damn good that it is so sad when all the other stuff fails so hard. For me personally this is probably the most dissapointing game for me since Batman Arkham Knight. Wanted it to be good so bad, but there is just so much wrong with this game.

Request to 2KGames: To be honest, I would rather pay $60 for a remastered HD version of Mafia1 on Steam, with some added content; than pay $60 for Mafia3. Which is supposed to not look as aged as it does upon release in 2016. +ADD FREE ROAM EXTREME DLC.  The game is medicore. It&#39;s just a plain and simple game. I&#39;ve played Mafia 1, 2, 3. Played all of the games to death (Collectiables, etc). Why didn&#39;t they re-add FreeRoam Extreme or anything. Continue or New Game; only options clickable at main menu. It seems like a downgrade to me coming from Mafia 2 to say the least. The combat is average, death animations are meh (~3 for every gun/melee), driving is like Watch Dogs/Godfather and car damage is...no. Reminds me of Godfather 2 car damage and combat with a mixture of Saints Row 3 HUD from console days.   The sky is choppy and pixelated, no option for draw distance - can&#39;t turn off Ambient Occlusion. When Lincoln Clay gets hit by a driving car, he doesn&#39;t fall to the ground, rag doll doesn&#39;t take place: stationary standing still and says &#39;UGH.&#39; You just got hit by a car, fall to the floor or do some kind of animation. Not just UGH. Clay can also exit a moving car at 90mph and roll to a safe standing pose with no damage being dealt. Didn&#39;t know Lincoln Clay was part of the Marvels squad. Fascinating. So much arcade present. We didn&#39;t ask for Joe&#39;s Adventures (M2), and yet you released it with a DLC cost. I watched and responded to people on the 2K forums, asking why you&#39;re adding point systems into the game. This isn&#39;t an arcade game, Mafia1 wasn&#39;t an arcade point game. It was story driven with cutscenes I will always remember. Do not do the same for Mafia3 as you did for the Mafia2 DLC.   Feel like I&#39;m at the Coin Arcades back in the 1990&#39;s looking for quarters to play House of the Dead. The half cutscenes (when talking to NPC/non important people) just look blurry and terribly scripted. Really just appears they put the game together too quickly. Nothing flows or feels like you want to come back to the game; nothing drags you back wanting to play more. Has very nice movie cutscenes, and that&#39;s about it. Mafia3 holds your hand through everything - telling you where to go from driving to an objective, pop ups during missions literally explaining what you have to do, to icons being on the car door. Icons everywhere, icons on everything, icons ICONS ICOONS. Where&#39;s the adventure? Where&#39;s the sense of mystery? Playing on Hard difficulty, they could have made the game HARDER and get rid of all the icons and additional help with this difficulty selected.  Majority of &#39;missions&#39; are go to point A, rough up X guy, go back and talk to guy C afterwards. It&#39;s a blast. The games&#39; world isn&#39;t feeling alive. I feel like an 8 year old being taught how to play video games for the first time. Rain doesn&#39;t splash off cars, water looks meh, no first person option or change 3rd person view height. Character has the stamina of a 100 year old that has some how survived after 3 packs of smokes a day (get more stamina through certain underboss perks, which is also dumb).  Cops. Not doing their job. What else is new though. Aren&#39;t pulling people over or getting into gun fights with NPCs. How unrealistic. Cops billy-clubbing everyone back in that day without question. Billy-club now, question maybe later; maybe not. Ontop of that, enemy AI is plain horrific.. Did they copy paste from Mafia1 AI? Probably the only thing they took out of M1. All the player has to do is crouch stealth through all the missions. No NPC will notice you if you stealth kill - so easy. When you get the silenced handgun you can literally crouch and 1 tap every enemy without difficulty. I&#39;ve hi-jacked a car in front of a patroling cop (walking on sidewalk), speed, fly through red lights, just about anything illegal in front of a cop; nothing happens. For some reason a little blue cursor looking thing pops up every time I pass a cop, but what&#39;s it for? Who knows. I&#39;m not wanted and I just commited at least 10 moving violations/felonies.   Enemy AI/Hitman will shoot at me outside of a mission, and cop does nothing on the street. Everything that M1/M2 had to offer, is no longer valid. You can&#39;t fix your cars up at the shop, put superchargers on them (Mafia2), store them (no house just compounds with nothing to do), no weapon customization, no era changing buildings or rooms (M2), get pulled over for speeding; nothing. I don&#39;t really know why they took so much content out of this game. What made Mafia, Mafia; is not there.  I&#39;ll always remember moments from Mafia1/Mafia2 story; Mafia3 not so much memorable. Chasing after Frank in M1, Hotel bomb plant in M2, M3 is just meh.  27&#39; BenQ XL2720Z AMD 8-Core FX-8350 ASUS Crosshair V Formula-Z SAPPHIRE Nitro R9 390 8GB (512-Bit) G.Skill Ripjaws X 8GB DDR3 1866 Corsair Force Series GS SSD DEEPCOOL CAPTAIN 240EX

***UPDATE***: Since the 1.2gb patch that was released just recently, the FPS limit can be set to 60, and even unlocked completely in the options menu. Some other of my issues have also been resolved (I&#39;ve stricken the points that no longer apply). I will keep my negative review up because I still don&#39;t feel it is quite where it should be just yet, in terms of the port work. Expect a revised review with future patches.  ***ORIGINAL***:  One of the laziest ports of a AAA-game I&#39;ve seen in years.   So, the game seems pretty interesting. Likeable characters, great animations, fantastic soundtrack, okay graphics, etc. I haven&#39;t nearly played enough to review the gameplay or story yet.  What I AM able to say something about, is the PORT work. And boy is this one lazy. I&#39;ll jot my main issues down in points:    1. You all know about the 30 FPS lock by now. And yes it is a fact. The game is currently locked at 30 FPS. Either I&#39;ve gotten so used to playing with my 144hz monitor over the past few years that my eyes have grown too accustomed to high-FPS play... Or something is wrong here. Something just feels off about how Mafia 3 runs. Like, it doesn&#39;t only run at 30 FPS; the gameplay just feels soggy and sluggish. Like everything&#39;s drenched in syrup.   2. There&#39;s mouse acceleration or smoothing or something going on, because the mouse movement is irritatingly imprecise. You&#39;re unable to disable that, of course.  3. Graphics options are laughably vague. Anti Aliasing choices, for example, are either &#39;Low&#39;, &#39;Medium&#39; or &#39;High&#39;. How hard would it be to give us the exact numbers? What is High, exactly? Is x8? What type of Anti Aliasing is it? FXAA? MLAA? MSAA?   4. Controls options are very limited, and the default settings are odd to say the least. While sneaking, you can whistle to attract the attention of enemies. Guess what button that&#39;s mapped to. Seriously, take a guess. Guess anything! I can guarantee you won&#39;t get it right. Guaranteed. Okay, have you guessed already? You ready for the answer? Ready? Okay. Delete. The default button to whistle while you&#39;re sneaking, is DELETE. Now, you can remap that button, but the fact that it&#39;s set to Delete just says something about how little the developers cared about making a proper port for the PC.   5. Further control issues; You can&#39;t map the mouse thumb buttons for anything. That is a HUGE offense for me. I use my thumb buttons in every game, and not being able to in 2016 is just odd. I accepted it back in the mid-2000s when thumb buttons were still &#39;new&#39; and not everybody had them on their mice. Today, there&#39;s no excuse for it.   6. There&#39;s no way to disable UI elements like the compass/map, the 3D navigation and so on. Minor gripe, but worth noting if you like customizing how the HUD looks.  7. The auto-centering during driving snaps into action really fast, and it&#39;s not possible to disable it. So if you&#39;re the kind of person who likes to look around while you&#39;re driving, you&#39;re going to get annoyed fast; you&#39;ll be fighting the camera with your mouse constantly.  8. You can change your graphics options in the launch menu before you actually boot up the game. Except the changes don&#39;t apply so you have to change them all again once the game has started. &#39;Luckily&#39;, there are only about five or so graphics options to choose between, ALL of which have the same choices; Low, Medium or High.  9. You have to adjust the edges of your screen when you launch the game for the first time. Why? Can&#39;t the game just detect that on its own? Another miniscule gripe, but it just adds to the whole feeling of lackluster interest for making a good port by the devs.  10. As mentioned lots of places already; the game does not support native 1920x1080 resolution. It&#39;s upscaled from what one would assume to be 800p (ie Xbox One standard). You can force it to look at least slightly sharper through the Nvidia control panel, but not nearly good enough to warrant that 30 FPS cap &#39;for performance&#39;s sake&#39;. I haven&#39;t seen a big game not being able to run at native 1080p resolution in over a decade now. It is absolutely puzzling to me why they would do this.   11. Remapping buttons is risky business, apparently. I remapped some buttons (like the weapon wheel), to Y. I just wanted it out of the way, really, as I won&#39;t be using it much. That is, until a tutorial message popped up, informing me that I could use Y to open the weapon wheel. I couldn&#39;t exit out of the message through any other way than hitting Y to open the wheel. Because the game needs to make sure that you aren&#39;t too stupid to understand what it had just told you, so it forces you to do exactly what it tells you. Alright, I&#39;ll play along. Y. Nothing. Y again. Y Y Y Y Y Y. Nope, it won&#39;t work. I can&#39;t get past it. I try hitting every single button on the keyboard, but nothing happens. I eventually just ALT-F4 and call it a night. F#$K this.    So, there&#39;s my early impressions of the port of the game. It&#39;s not abysmal, it&#39;s not unplayable (I haven&#39;t had any crashes yet). But it&#39;s lazy, and you can tell that the developers (or publishers) threw this port together in a hurry to make a buck, rather than showing the PC version the respect it deserves.   There&#39;s a good game in here, it would seem. You just have to fight a lot of unnecessary battles to be able to enjoy it. And I wouldn&#39;t currently recommend it at full price on the PC. Let&#39;s see if they get that 30FPS lock fixed first.

I have to say im disappointed with this game. Most of the reviews you read will all say they dont like it because the fps was at 30 (before recent patch), for me though even after the patch I can&#39;t get into it.     To start, the game is remarkably different from the second. For someone who really enjoyed the second game this is a shame. The characters you meet in this game are people you will forget very quickly, unlike Mafia ll (Joe,Henry).     Mafia 3 starts off well but hits a low point when you start doing some of the missions. They are very repetitive and boring. Its all the same, go here interrogate this guy, do $20,000 in damage, &#39;boss&#39;. After doing this a few times and spending 6 hours on this game,I found myself losing interest.    For someone who hasn&#39;t played any of the previous Mafia games, it might be worth to checkout. For people who have played the others though, Personally I can&#39;t recommend this game. Not because of performance, graphics, just because the story and missions are not that rewarding, In my opinion at least.

Nevermind the 30 FPS. (Fixed in patch 1.01)  - No saving, only one constantly overwriting checkpoint system. Want to re-play a mission or go for different decision? Well, you better start the game all the way from the start again then. - Contains a ton of incredibly lazy and boring, unskippable cutscenes where Clay talks with one of the minor story characters. All of them shot from exactly same camera angle, which never moves, and neither do the characters. They give no info related to the main story and did I mention they are unskippable. - Hold [DEL] as a default keybind. (Default keybindings have been improved in patch 1.01) - Game fails to detect native screen resolution. Was set 1600 x 900 on my 1920 x 1080 screen. - In-game options can&#39;t handle using Steam overlay. Enabling and then disabling Steam overlay while options menu is on closes the option menu, even if you are in middle of making changes. - Rolling menus, yes, you must wait for the menu to roll past Kill list, Assets, Journal tabs to get to Options. - All weapon stats in percentages, including ammo capacity. Freaking love these revolvers with 15% and semi auto pistols with 31% ammo capacity. - Mouse sensitivity settings are a mess. Mouse sensitivity in menus is extremely high, bringing sensitivity down to usable levels in menus brings in-game sensitivity to unusably low. Menu mouse behaviour also suffers from mouse de-acceleration. - The game has a backlighting profile for Logitech RGB keyboards, which only makes things worse. Just three red vertical stripes, does not illuminate keys that are actually bound for gameplay functions. - Lock opening QTE gets repetitive and old really fast. - Looks horrible because everything on screen is softened/blurred so heavily. For example faces at about 20 meter distance are blurred into solid brown blobs. No sharpness anywhere. No combination of graphics settings seems to fix this. - Death and money mechanics. When you die, instead of &#39;loading last save&#39; you lose 50% of your money and you continue with whatever ammunition you had when dying. Respawned with 5 ammo on the pistol and 3 on SMG. -&amp;gt; Go buy more ammo before getting back to action. - Camera positions when driving are way too low. There are near, medium and far camera positions, but none of them actually are set high enough to be properly able to see in front of you. This also adds to the bad looking graphics when ground textures are viewed from a flattened angle. - Deadlocked traffic jams that break &#39;follow that car&#39; missions. - Badly executed subtitles where long blocks of text are often cut in middle of sentences and the timings are off.   Mafia III manages to implement usability problems I&#39;ve never even seen before. It is incredible that they have managed to put effort into making things worse from usability point of view.

EDIT: I just beat the game so I decided to reformat the review and add any final thoughts  I never got around to playing Mafia 1 but I loved everything about Mafia 2 back in the day. The gritty realism, the somewhat unique story, and all the small mechanics that made the world feel so real and different from the other sandbox games at the time. If I had to choose right now, I would probably play it over GTA 4. Because of this, I got relatively excited for this iteration. I avoided every trailer, gameplay video, and blog post to not get my hopes up so that I could have an ubiased and uninformed play through this game. But after only a day of playing I have realized that this is a poor mans GTA for a rich mans price.  Pros:  - Story: The beginning, ending, and some of the story missions in between are very well done and will motivate some people to get through the repetitiveness of the game - Setting: I don&#39;t remember any games that take place in the racist South during the 60s, playing as a black man on top of that just sweatens the deal - Soundtrack: Every time I play a game like Fallout, Mafia or GTA I love the soundtrack. This game is no different. However, it is a let down that there are only three radio stations to choose from - Characters: The personality for each main and side character is unique and very well done. And their voice acting is top notch. I wasn&#39;t suprised to see the long list of voice actors in the credits because no one sounds identical - Cutscenes: Every time a cutscene starts I have to sit back and just appreciate how good they look. Other than some small shadow and clipping issues, the character models and facial animations are amazingly done. However, this is also a negative because once you get back into the game it brings home how ugly it is  - Story Missions: The only interesting and unique missions are the story missions which take place after taking over a district. There are around 12 of these missions (not all of them are good) with boring filler missions in between each one  Cons: - Graphics: This game is ugly. The intro cutscene got me excited to delve into a nice looking game, but it is obvious that this is a console port once you actually start playing. It&#39;s almost comparable to a mid gen PS3 game. Where are the GTA 5 level graphics that are shown in the cutscenes? I found that the only time this game looks good is at very specific times of the day, and at night. For about 95% of the day, the sun is blindingly bright and washes everything out - Pop in: This ties into the graphics. Cars and objects pop into view about 50 yards ahead of you, which makes driving really fast in the oncoming lane very dangerous. The pop in is even more evident in the rearview mirror. A wall of brown chases you and swallows everything 50 yards behind you - Audio: Everything is cranked up to the max. No matter how far away someone is yelling from you, it sounds like they are right next to you. This makes it very difficult to track down the last guy you have to kill - Driving: I don&#39;t even know what happened here. I&#39;ve tried both driving modes and simulation mode is the most playable, but they both feel like you&#39;re driving an arcadey tank that can just plow through any car. I can hit an oncoming car at 100mph and take no damage but slightly nudge a stationary vehicle and almost die - Missions: There are four different types of missions that are repeated throughout the entire game. It&#39;s either: kill/interrogate this person or steal/destroy something. And all of the racket boss missions reuse the same buildings so there are no more collectibles or money stacks to find and pick up after the first visit - AI: I can&#39;t remember the last game that had AI this stupid. They can&#39;t see more than two feet infront of them so every mission leads to me running around stealth killing everyone without ever getting caught. And if you get bored of that and want to shoot some people, have fun with enemies that run at you in the open or poke their head out of the same cover until you shoot them. And once you get a silenced weapon the game becomes a joke. You can clear out an entire warehouse without being careful and no one will notice. Two enemies were next to each other talking and I killed one and the other guy kept talking while he took his gun out and walked around for a bit. No reaction to his friend being shot in the head right infront of him  - Cops: Are cops even in this game? Throughout the entire game I only had to deal with them when the story forced it. I have driven through red lights, in the oncoming lane, going 100mph, right infront of a police station and gotten nothing more than a little police awareness bar. I&#39;ve also gone on a massacre and killed everyone in an area and nothing came from it. Witnesses to a crime will run past a cop to get to a phone booth instead of just telling the officer that&#39;s walking by - Customization: I thought I hadn&#39;t gotten far enough into the game yet, but no, there is absolutely no customization. There isn&#39;t a clothing store or garage in site so you&#39;re stuck with Lincoln&#39;s army jacket, and car upgrades are purely performance and not cosmetic - Weather: The skybox rivals that of old N64 games and the rain is ugly. The most obvious and possibly the ugliest part of the game is that the time of day changes in waves instead of gradually. If you&#39;re driving fast enough you can actually race the time change and stay on the line between morning and afternoon. It is very distracting when it&#39;s bright out and then suddenly a wave of darkness comes over everything - FPS: Before the patch, I was holding a consistent 30fps. But since changing it to 60fps I have been bouncing between 24-39fps. My rig is fully capable of running a game like this at max settings at over 60fps. Be upfront with your costumers and tell them that you haven&#39;t optimized the game to run at 60fps, instead of leading us on like this - The Interviews: The idea of having present day interviews with characters from the game was very interesting. But they didn&#39;t know when to stop. Between every mission they felt like they had to have a short interview cutscene, which really breaks the immersion of the game. And there were some parts of the game where I was thinking how the hell I was going to pull the mission off. But then you are promptly interrupted by an interview that spoils the entire mission and that everything went to plan. From the very beginning of the game you already know what happens to Lincoln and Sal because of what Father James says in his interviews  Overall: This game is a huge disapointment. It has its ups and down like any game but its ups don&#39;t carry it very far. I miss the days of Mafia 2 with all its little details that showed how much the devs cared. Cars had fuel, you could shop at or rob every open store, stores closed for a day if the employees were killed, cops punished you for breaking traffic laws, cops kept track of your license plate and clothing so that you had to change them, and every mission was vital  to the story and didn&#39;t feel like a filler side mission. The thing about this game is that it does nothing new. The story, while enjoyable, is very predictable. And every game mechanic that is present or missing has been done 100 times better before. The Godfather 2, which is a 7 year old game, accomplished more than this game. Wait until a huge patch comes out, or until the game is at most $30. Hangar 13 and 2K, thank you for treating a huge demographic as second class citizens with this abysmal and lazy port

This game was praised by all the game magazines waaay before it&#39;s release.  Don&#39;t get mislead by the title. The previous two &#39;Mafia&#39; games let you play a Mafioso. Now you play some random black person hunting down the mob.  So now I got a few hours into it:  PRO: - GREAT music. if you like the genre - decent story  Cons: - LESS content than Mafia 2 - NO new game mechanics. Nothing. Could be a 2010 sandbox game, or earlier. - Repetitive missions. Main quests feel like sidequests. Redundant.  Get it on a sale and you&#39;re ok. But don&#39;t buy 60 bucks for it.  Edit: Here, some dude made a video comparing Mafia 2 to Mafia 3. Now keep in mind, Mafia 2 is 6 years older than this game. Enjoy:   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixlszwKVVP0    That says it all ;)

Game still runs like crap, Badly optimized, waited literally a month for CUSTOMIZATION and car customization still isn&#39;t in the game, The game is buggy, ugly, released 30fps lock, BORING because you do the same side objectives OVER and OVER AND OVER again forcefully. I paid $60 for the game and the season pass. Just giving hope that It will be good because of mafia 2. 2k shouldn&#39;t have published a boring broken game and hanger 13 are on my no purchase list EVER. Most of my hours from this game are from it being on while I watched tv or left the house because It&#39;s so god awfully boring to play. Stay away from this it is a WAIT until (finished+all DLC released$20-30) used at gamestop where you say &#39;Hmm, I never bought this before so I may as well try it because I have trade credit&#39; type of game. Oh god why have you done this to me? I&#39;m poor af and I wasted $60 on this garbage. Buy on consoles for a smooth gameplay.

Oh dear, where should i start here? I hold off my review so they could release the patch unlocking the framerate and actually be able to play this since 30 fps is unplayable for me. After 11 hours in, this is what i got from it.  - Performance of the pc version is garbage, not much to be said here, not even a gtx 1080 is able to sustain steady 60fps on max settings. - It looks like sh_i_t. Low res blurry textures, graphical glitches all over the place related to lighting and shadows, insane pop-in, ugly weather effects. - The game is unstable. Many users are experiencing crashes at the moment. I was able to reduce their frequency by limiting the framerate to 60 from uncapped but it still does it at least 1 time per 2 hours of gameplay, usually at the worst moment. It can also crash during autosaving and corrupt your savefile so good luck with that (hasn&#39;t happend to me, yet). I know it&#39;s not something on my end because i have played dozens of games on my configuration without a hitch. - Buggy as hell. npc&#39;s clipping through walls, cars floating in the air, sometimes missions won&#39;t start unless i reload the checkpoint. It feels unpolished and rushed. - Repetitive missions. So far i&#39;ve seen only a few types of missions, kill someone, interrogate someone, destroy something, take out the boss. There is some fun to be had here, but doing the same thing over and over and over again gets old real fast. A little more variation (like mafia 2) could do wonders. - Npc AI is straight up ret.a.rded. I won&#39;t go into details because i&#39;d like to keep this review from being too long. Just watch this nice dude&#39;s video and have some laughs too  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZokdmzvDGA   I know i pretty much buried the game but there are some good aspects too. Interesting story presentation and characters, solid combat mechanics (nothing groundbreaking, but enough to keep you going), nice music and voice acting. Sadly, these are not enough for me to recommend Mafia 3. Even if they fix all the technical issues, which i highly doudt, it still going to be a shallow and repetitive experience.

sigh....... what to say about this game. well...... i was excited to hear it was announced and I couldn&#39;t wait, since mafia 2 was fun. but i did keep in my mind thinking it&#39;s a different game company and we all know how it is when a good game goes to diffent game developers and it it bombs &#39; cough cough halo 4&#39; so i had an open mind going into the game. but WOW did they ♥♥♥♥ up hard. basically the game is like destiny but with a story. you do the same mission over and over again for 30 hours. at first the game was intersting but after 5 hours into the game you don&#39;t care for the story anyomre because the game gets really tedious. Now the world environment. it&#39;s a ♥♥♥♥ing joke. you remember those cool moments in mafia 2, going to a resturaunt drunk off your ♥♥♥ holding everyone hostage while the cops trying to get you? well the dev&#39;s decided to say &#39;♥♥♥♥ you&#39; to the communtity and you can&#39;t do any of that ♥♥♥♥. All you can do is steal a car and beat up civilians..... thats it. and the cops WOW is that the biggest &#39; ♥♥♥♥ you&#39; ever. they are basically gta cops except they are more racist. If they just see you they will go after you and start shooting. and to escape you just leave a circle. It ♥♥♥♥ing sucks. the dev&#39;s of this game got so ♥♥♥♥ing lazy and didn&#39;t add anything to the world to make it fun. the world is just there for you to get to one place to another and no fun in the middle. what makes open world games fun is the actual map of it&#39;s self is the icing and the story is the cake. Parts of the cake is there but the icing is just ♥♥♥♥. So i don&#39;t recomend this game to anyone. stay away from this game. it&#39;s not worth $60.  I forgot to mention 1 really nice thing about the game though. and that is it&#39;s badasss soundtrack. anyone that you talk to that has the game will say that the soundtrack is amazing. when you get to the main menu and hear jimmi hendrix all along the watchtower it brings some nostalgia. and then it ends when you press play sadly

Great city, strong-starting story that just trails off near the end as Lincoln becomes more and more edgy. The &#39;Mafia&#39; part is just a sideshow AI is absolutely the single worst AI i&#39;ve seen in a game... ever. Driving is meh Every mission is the same. Shooting gallery, destroy this stuff, wire a few boxes if you want an &#39;advantage.&#39;  Hangar 13 gave a good shot at it, but it turned out half-finished and a lot of features were cut that were in Mafia 2. Could&#39;ve been 2K&#39;s fault, since they published the game, as in they forced Hangar 13 to release it early for budget or... whatever reason. But you never really know. Sigh... guess I&#39;ll go back to MGS V and spend two weeks working for the money I spent on this game back.

Beyond the obvious issues with capped FPS, extremely low resolution textures, lack of graphical options and the whole game being 720p upscaled to whatever resolution you&#39;re running it at.. I&#39;ve now come across another splendid issue (or, for me, the final nail in the coffin):  Autosaves.  I&#39;ve lost over five hours of progress so far purely because they just don&#39;t work.  The game is supposed to autosave any time you start a story mission, complete a story mission, or take over a new racket. Despite me doing all of these the game hasn&#39;t saved my progress at any point, with the only exception being when I cleared the Hollows. Since then, I&#39;ve been able to play the game, but instantly lose my progress anytime I die or exit the game.  I honestly can&#39;t believe something this game breaking would make it into the &#39;final&#39; release. All the other issues aside, how did this one go unnoticed? You can&#39;t even manually save the game. Was there no Q/A whatsoever? Am I just very dumb and not triggering autosaves, despite making literal hours of progress? I have no idea what&#39;s the case at this point.  I would honestly refund this game if I hadn&#39;t already played more than two hours.  --  As for the gameplay:  The AI is by and large very buggy.  The world has lots of pop in from time to time which is jarring when it happens (roads randomly disappearing for a few frames, garage doors being solid colored polygons, etc -- this is on an SSD by the way so it&#39;s probably not a bottleneck on my end).  The vehicle handing is very poor, even on the &#39;simulator&#39; setting.  The mechanic for storing money in your safehouse is very clunky. It actually gets replaced almost immediately with a better option, which in my opinion, makes the whole mechanic feel pointless.  The world lacks depth, as the only places you can enter are used for story missions, and you&#39;re forced to return to them a few times for some story missions. It can get kind of tiring to clear the same club two or three times. There are exceptions to this of course, such as random garages and storefronts.. which are only used to store collectibles and medkits.. or at other times.. are just completely empty.  The stealth mechanic is very weak. Moving between cover is clunky, as is whistling to get an enemy&#39;s attention, you get a throwable item that sort of replaces whistling later on that can receive upgrades but I don&#39;t find much use in it. It&#39;s very easy, even on the hardest difficulty, to just clear an entire area with a tommygun without using stealth whatsoever.  Now, despite all this, it is an enjoyable game and the story is quite nice so far. It&#39;s just nothing I&#39;d write home about, it might improve as you unlock more abilities and upgrades but since I can&#39;t (or rather, would rather not) make it past the first zone until the autosaving issue is fixed, I wouldn&#39;t know.

The 30fps cap isn&#39;t the biggest problem of this game.   Let me put this first: I am a Mafia franchise fan. Always have been. I bought Mafia on it&#39;s release in English and German. I preordered Mafia II. I bought every single DLC for Mafia II and I played them all. I have more than 100 hours of playtime in Mafia II according to Steam. I preordered Mafia III and was looking forward to it and it&#39;s new setting.   However, Mafia III isn&#39;t closely as good as it&#39;s predecessors.   I won&#39;t give you a final rating of the story or setting of Mafia III. Some people didn&#39;t appreciante that they moved from an Italian Mafia background to a black gang background. I was (and still am in a way) open-minded towards it and a bit apprehensive. I haven&#39;t played much of the story yet but so far it seems alright, even though I got the feeling that I might already know where things are going.   The conversations and cutcenes are still of high quality. IMO the cutcenes are at least on a Mafia II level, maybe even better.   So that&#39;s fine. What&#39;s the problem? Primarily the game&#39;s technology. I won&#39;t even mention the 30fps problem this game has but it has bad graphics, bad controlls, bad sound and bad physics.   As long as your on foot these problems aren&#39;t that noticeable. Shooting and the cover system are similar to that of Mafia II. There are some developer decisions that I have to critizise in this regard though: Your health will regenerate really fast. You also have the option to take a medkit in order to regenerate it instantly. Enemies are very passive during shootouts. You can easily kill them from cover even on highest difficulty. The protagonist seems kinda overpowered.   This becomes even more apparent when you take a look at melee fights: When you approach an enemy from behind you can instantly kill him / knock him out. But even when you run towards him you can knock him out with one or two hits (unarmed people on the street get knockt out after one single hit). There is no advanced melee fighting system like in Mafia I or II.   Most of the technlogical problems this game has only become visible once you get in a car and drive around a bit.  Driving itself is very underwhelming to begin with. You can still select &#39;Simulation&#39; driving mode in the menu but even if you do so the handling is very easy. You can drive at full throttle all the time without any problems. You can &#39;drift&#39; on a straight street. The whole driving model is very basic, unrealstic and easy. I don&#39;t think I can find any open world game with a comparable driving model in the last ~10 years.   You will also notice several other problems while driving through the streets:   -Mafia III&#39;s world might be bigger than that of Mafia II or Mafia I but it feels empty and lacks details.  -The car&#39;s motor sounds are bad. They don&#39;t change when you accelerate or make a burnout. The Thunderbird has the sound of a sewing machine.  -When you hit another other car with high speed it will barely slow you down but fly through the air like it was hit by a NASA rocket  -All static objects other than traffic signs are undestroyable and will stop you instantly if you crash into them though. Even some(!) phone booths.  -When you drive into a pedestrian they will be stand in front of your car while beeing pushed around. They will drop dead as soon as you stop. I have seen better solutions in open world games of the pre-GTAIV-era!  -Volumetric smoke? Nope!  -All in all bad effects -Aggressivee LOD -Bad textures -Low draw distance -Fog -In the first daylight missions the weather will change within seconds from super light sunny with massive bloom effects to dark clouded and back. Quite annoying.  -All in all very bad lighting in the first daylight missions (bug?).  -Ugly, low detailed car models! Really. There are cars that look like they are out of the 50&#39;s. Some have a strong resemblance with cars that where in Mafia II. But they didn&#39;t take the models from Mafia II. They created new, similar looking models that look worse on closer inspectation. Makes me wonder why. Did they just buy the name and not the rights to use previous content?  -The damage models of the cars are worse than in Mafia II -Sometimes shadows are casted to different directions  There are also bugs where certain items fly in the air because furniture isn&#39;t displayed or instances where the player falls through the floor of the map.    Conclusion

As of now, I have no other choice but to leave a negative review of this game and advise not to buy it until proper PC support is implemented. I&#39;ve played 55min and the game seems that it can be a good game, I like the atmosphere and the style but the lack of better PC support is not acceptable in 2016.   The 30fps cap has no place in PC gaming and worst of all the developer hide this info until the very end! I cannot accept this kind of behavior towards gamers! Too many times this developers use the &#39;day one&#39; patch to fix a game after release, well, the game should be fixed before release and if it is not, then, either delay or in the very least let the consumer know what is going on! But not fixing it and not divulging this info is not acceptable!  Also, 21:9 is not properly supported. It has lots of glitches in menus (words and graphics get cutted)  I won&#39;t play anymore until the patch and after trying that I&#39;ll either change my review to a positive one or just get a refund for a game that was not made to work on PCs.  For now I cannot recomend this game!

TL/DR: save yourself some time and money if you&#39;re new to the mafia franchise and buy mafia 2.  *UPDATED* for those interested review follows:  ♥♥♥♥ textures (muddy,grainy, blurry with some SERIOUSLY low res roads walls and general environment) that look like they were ripped straight out of Prototype (a game from 2008 WTF 2K?),   story is basically shadow of mordor set in new orleans (Same premise same gameplay BUT NOW WITH GUNS AND CARS! Boss mechanics and story points are basically ripped sraight from Shadow of Mordor along with the whole story being near identical... but being set in 1960&#39;s america) standard revenge storyline low stress,   I&#39;ve noticed a whole lot of people commenting on the story of the game and how &#39;brave&#39; the developers were to take on a troubled era in American history (rampant racism being the main trouble) and while I might not have been alive in the 1960&#39;s (I&#39;m 20) i do feel compelled to comment on the use of racism in this game: It appears that the use of racism is purely there as fluff to distract from the fact that the character interaction is really non-existent and very poorly written (probably in an attempt to make you feel something that the character fail to evoke) with completely forgettable characters being thrust forward and never actually developed or fleshed out. You can read more about them in the in game bio screens but from a pure storytelling perspective they are basically flat hollow mission givers with no real reason to care about them or Lincoln&#39;s straight Shadow of Mordor campaign or even Lincoln himself! I personally couldn&#39;t tell you a damn thing about any of the characters I met during my 5/6 hours with the game and that&#39;s a real shame.  rinse and repeat missions (There&#39;s so ♥♥♥♥ING MANY of these they got boring and repetitive extremely quickly), often recycling the same layouts and environments for different &#39;missions&#39; even enemy placements have very little variation,  crap controls (mouse acceleration with no off switch? c&#39;mon guys that&#39;s just lazy/no working key rebind system? ♥♥♥♥ sake),   *FIXED* 30FPS lock out of the box (I know its been said like a million times but it matters),   HOWEVER this now presents the issue pertaining to maintaining a consistent 60fps this game running on my system on high reaches 40fps with the fps locked to 60 NOW i would like to take the time to outline the system that this game is running on:  Intel Core i7 5960X @ 4.5 Ghz 16 GB of Corsair Dominator Platinum at 2400 Mhz 2 EVGA GTX 980 ti&#39;s 6GB in SLI (the system req&#39;s call for a single 290X or 780 from 2013...) Samsung 850 Evo Pro 1TB All sitting on a ASUS Rampage V Extreme All custom watercooled  this system should eat this game up and spit it the ♥♥♥♥ out 3 times over ESPECIALLY as it runs Witcher 3 on ultra at a solid 60FPS without breaking a sweat, this brings the issue up of just poor optimisation for the PC platform and explains why they didn&#39;t put full 60 on from the start. PC was an afterthought, a cliff note, a &#39;oh ♥♥♥♥ we forgot do that&#39; moment and thats not right we bought the game same as everyone else treat us with at least a little ♥♥♥♥ing respect you did willfully take our money.   no SLI support,   menu&#39;s are a joke, blurry aliased text (if you play at a res higher than 1080p) CLEARLY designed for controllers not a mouse and keyboard (as in it has no mouse input at all apart from in maybe the new game section but still displays the cursor),  if you want to play in 21:9 good luck dealing with all the artifacting that comes with it (lighting bugs, discolouration, interface designs e.g the low health blood that appears only covers a 16:9 space...) including a rave party at the edges of the screen whenever you go indoors (spoiler alert you might have to do that quite a bit),   texture pop in is a MAJOR issue with this game along with a HIDEOUS draw distance that means things get properly rendered when they&#39;re 10 ft away (by rendered i of course mean that the textures just pop into existence extremely noticeably)   enemies take 1/2 to a full mag to kill if not shot in the head and even then its not a sure thing (the ♥♥♥♥ am I fighting luke cage? I was playing the game on medium btw mother ♥♥♥♥ers take 7 shots in the chest and keep walking)  the police system that was in mafia 2 has been stripped down to cops shoot on sight if you run a red light (what happened to the fine/arrest/shoot/wanted system?)  cover system works well if not a little temperamental on occasion  shooting felt fine but i found myself constantly running out of ammo due to the aforementioned Luke Cage esque enemies  sneak felt like beating up on quadriplegic kids because the AI is legit totally incapable of seeing you crouched in front of them  driving is either PEDAL TO THE METAL or FULL STOP there is no in between and you&#39;ll spend most of your time wrestling for control of the car (the game then has the cheek to offer you &#39;simulation driving&#39; to make is harder... what were they thinking...)  the standard formula of go here kill this was a common theme... wait ... the only theme that ran though this game and the story only gave context (sometimes it&#39;s really paper thin) as to why you are doing what your doing  the game also has these kind-of not cutscenes but cutscenes where you and the person you&#39;re meeting with stand awkwardly and wooden with dialogue playing overtop it (this happens WAY more than it should) normally preceeding you going to a place and shooting the ♥♥♥♥ out of it like 90% of the other missions that Clay will be undertaking  lastly the options menu is a disaster the graphics settings seem to do nothing to the look of the game having swapped from high to low and low to high the only real difference I could see was the ambient occlusion was missing on the low preset but texture difference is basically non existant (Im starting to think that low and high are the same thing in the config file)  huge disappointment was a game that i was really looking forward to... :(  UPDATE: Steam won&#39;t refund me my money so i guess it&#39;s only fair that IF (&amp;lt; big if) any of this ♥♥♥♥ gets fixed i will update this review accordingly

I can&#39;t recomment this game, okay the cut scenes look great, but that&#39;s all.... I&#39;m playing this on Hard and I&#39;m just walking through this, little to no challenge, this is a bad port for the PC glitches and graphics wise disapointed, won&#39;t recomment it.

So yeah, it took me 39 hours to play through this game. That&#39;s not bad for a modern game, though of course I did take my sweet time and did all the side missions as well, and gathered all collectibles (still can&#39;t find that last album cover, it does not appear on the map).  Anyway, I honestly don&#39;t know whether I can recommend this title or not. I&#39;ll list the pros and cons, first things first.  Pros:  -Vito! -Great cutscenes! -No fast travel! -Music! -Gunfights (stealthmode is also very intuitive!) -The city is huge! -Well designed cars (they don&#39;t use any real life cars, but rather make some up by mixing existing ones - they really did a great job on that) - the driving is alright as well, although I feel that it should&#39;ve been a greater challenge, especially since I was in simulation mode! -Upgrades for cars, your character, and item slots. Gives a nice sense of development as you progress through the story!  Cons:  -Handholding. Arrows pointing to your current objectives at all times, for example - it&#39;s just not necessary. You&#39;re also just a quick phonecall away to have a car delivered, weapons to purchase, and money to store. You can also disable phones with this &#39;feature&#39;, and eventually be able to call off the cops, even... I mean.... eh. It&#39;s just way too easy to succeed in this game. Handholding is bad. -Poor graphics, badly optimized. They look very blurry compared to other games, and there&#39;s no visual difference between high and low? Ok then. The framerate also suffered at times, though not too bad, at least for me. -Rackets. These are incredibly boring and repetitive - and you get to do them about 500 billion times. -Forced to unlock story missions. This is the worst move by far. -Very little depth to the majority of the characters. Example: You are forced to take over rackets and districts and whatnot to unlock more dialogue with some characters, and eventually you unlock this super dramatic dialogue and find yourself not giving two ♥♥♥♥s because... well why would you? There&#39;s little to no story behind the characters, and you just can&#39;t sympathize. Basically the majority of the characters are just shallow. Not that great for a supposedly &#39;story rich&#39; game.  I think that&#39;s everything, so now you see why I do not know whether to recommend this game or not. Hmm... signs point to no. The way the game is now... I just can&#39;t recommend it. Maybe if they release a patch to optimize it better - that way the pros will outbalance the cons.  This is just my personal opinion - if you like doing repetitive stuff for hours on end to see how the main story unfolds, then by all means go for it. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s worth the price that Steam is listing it for though.

Too repetitive to recommend, 14 hours in and the story&#39;s barely moved, and I just got a whole ton MORE busywork to advance the story. They watered down a couple aspects that I liked from Mafia 2. I&#39;ve been tearing around town, speeding past cops, and no one has noticed. Doesn&#39;t look like they care at all about speeding violations anymore. Also I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a fuel gauge anymore either, not a big deal, but I kinda liked that in Mafia 2, even tho I hardly ever had to fuel up.  The missions I&#39;ve played so far are alright, but it&#39;s just the same thing over and over, oftentimes in the same locations as you&#39;ve done almost the exact same mission within the past hour. The driving feels ok. Not exceptional, but I&#39;m kind of a stickler for driving physics and I don&#39;t hate it, they feel a little stiff but still on the fun side of serviceable. Story&#39;s compelling so far.  This game ran like hot garbage at first, couldn&#39;t even maintain 30fps without stutters. Seems like it was CPU limited, maxxing my CPU repeatedly. Then I turned on Hyperthreading in my Bios, and it cleared all the stutters right up. Activity monitor shows none of the cores (real or virtual) getting maxxed out, and the load is spread quite evenly across them. This is the first application I&#39;ve ever seen hyperthreading make ANY difference on, and the difference was night and day. Bizarre.  Now I can maintain 60fps/1080p with mostly medium settings, reflections and AA set to low. If I turn reflections up to medium, it&#39;s a playable 40-60fps, usually 50-60. i7 3770k, gtx980, 16gb ddr3, ssd. Not terribly impressive, given I can run GTA V with most settings maxxed, but better than playing the slideshow I was seeing for the first hour of gameplay.

**I&#39;ll update after more play time.**  This is a painful review because the cut scenes and story in this game is very very good. The game made me almost instantly care about the characters of the game. I wanted to see Lincoln Clay through the end and I&#39;ll still give it a shot. Facial expressions during cut scenes and voice acting is awesome and after about 30 minutes of it in the intro, you&#39;re very excited to get out into the open world and tear up the city and see what else the game has to offer. After you leave the first area though and into the second part of town you start to see the games limitations, and it&#39;s painfully obvious.  I&#39;m going to put aside the games CURRENT 30fps lock and lack of SLI support (as someone running 2 GTX 1080&#39;s it&#39;s really frustrating to see a AAA game locked at 30 and no SLI support), even though it screams &#39;I&#39;m another shoddy PC port.&#39; Even though this also happened during my gameplay:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkfmFV_2Lhc  So with the potential PC conflicts aside lets juts look at two massive issues I see with the game itself.  Graphics: Very muddy textures. If you spotted Angry Joe&#39;s rant where he used the sky as an example and litterally compared the sky in this game to the sky in Zelda: Ocarina of Time on the Nintendo 64. It&#39;s pretty sad to see how lazy development got here. Some of the tree&#39;s and vegitation does look decent though, as a plus. However it&#39;s hard to miss the poor textures when walking around the city, even when playing it on resolutions beyond 1080p  Missions and game design: Yesterday I tracked down a collectable Playboy in an area. It was inside warehouse on the second floor. There where some stairs leading on the outside going straight to it. A few hours later I found myself in a totally different area of the game. I noticed another collectable playboy on the map and I went to collect it. When I got there I got hit with deja vu as I quickly noticed that this warehouse was EXACTLY the same warehouse as the first. Quite literally as even the funature, boxes, desks, machines, random garbage strewn about the place and even the god damn playboy was even in the EXACT same spot. You&#39;ll find a lot of places that are like this in the game.  As far as missions go, you will find yourself repeating the same missions over and over again as you take over rackets in the city. Which will get exceptionally tedious over time. If you are trying to collect everything, it will make the game really hard to complete as you will find that you are forcing yourself to get through the last half.   Based off my initial impressions so far. It&#39;s hard to reccomend this right now. Who knows what DLC will bring to it and how it will change. Also still waiting on this patch that will unlock the frame rate, However in it&#39;s current form as of THIS date this game is a hard reccomendation. If you loved Mafia 2 and really want to see how the story continues, you&#39;ll probably enjoy the story. If you&#39;re someone just looking for a good game, than hold off a little bit and see how 2k handles the post launch aftermath.  **Edit** So the patch to unlock the frames is out SLI still isn&#39;t supported, but I expected far better than 60fps with a EVGA SC 1080 at 1440p. Inside I was getting between 60-70 fps. The second I hit the road and started driving I had dips into the high 40&#39;s. Unless you&#39;re playing at 4k, a dip into 40fps with a card like that is unacceptable. The game needs to be optimized more.

Updated: This is not an acceptable game for 2016. The amount of glitches, repetitiveness, and lack of other missions, and jobs to do after you complete the story is poor. Mafia 3 tried hard to bring back the Mafia series, but it crashed and burned. I had so much hope for this game, but it turned out to be another No Man&#39;s Sky of 2016.  Original Post Below: This great video by CrowbCat shows the many things wrong with Mafia III PC version.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZokdmzvDGA   This is what happens when you give a good game series to a different developer who has no idea on how to make proper video games. I had so high hopes for this game, but I was let down once again by the gaming industry.  This game is so awful. When I decided to play on PC, it was because I have a choice. I could choose my hardware, my software, my resolution, my framerate, and my graphics, but what Hangar 13 did is unacceptable. They locked the game to 30FPS, and their reason for that is: &#39;The team has been hard at work ensuring that Mafia III’s performance is consistent across all platforms, and right now the game runs at a solid 30 frames-per-second.&#39;   That&#39;s the most ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t I have ever heard in one sentence. Mafia III for PC is a console port. The game has so many problems when it comes to reflections, lighting, and no SLI support. The antialiasing just blurs the game to make the edges look better, the PC controls are horrendous, and the game is being upscaled from 720p. It&#39;s so damn hard to focus on the story aspect when the screen is tearing, the graphics are glitching out, things pop in at ridiculous distance, but wait, they are releasing a patch to make the game run over 60FPS, and fix the issues. Too late, you already screwed up the game&#39;s launch, and what you have done will not be forgotten. They did release the patch to unlock the framerate, but since they never optimized the game good, it still runs like ♥♥♥♥. This was my birthday present, and it&#39;s the worst ♥♥♥♥ing birthday present I have ever gotten. Hangar 13 didn&#39;t deliver on their promise on putting time, and effort into their PC version. You had 5 ♥♥♥♥ing years to sort all this ♥♥♥♥ out, but you didn&#39;t. Nice job Hangar 13, you made a sequel to Mafia II worse.  Don&#39;t buy this game.

I&#39;ve played through the game twice, A majority of my playing time is offline thus my hours aren&#39;t reflecting actual time in-game.  Good game but still feels as though we&#39;re being guided along the rails. This feels like a step back from Mafia 2. No clothes shops, no car workshops, no gas stations. Graphics were pretty blah out of the box, but after the patch that unlocked FPS and a ReShade preset, the game looks pretty good on a 1070 GTX. It ran consistently, based on the Steam overlay, at 56-57 FPS.  Pros:  -Little details - reactions to PC, witnesses calling in crimes, etc. The city feels alive.  -Environmental/Weather system (people use umbrellas when it&#39;s raining, streets get wet when it rains, and they gradually dry after rains)  -Story is very good  -Voice acting is exceptional  Cons:  -Weather system - sometimes it rained for days at a time, and weather changed far too abruptly at times.   -Side missions to increase racket income are repetitive and tedious. This is where a lot of time in the game will be spent as objectives are clear on the other side of the map from you.  -Enemy and Police AI needs some serious attention. Enemies were completely inept unless it was a scripted event. As far as police: No speeding tickets, I could ram into cars all day in front of police but if I accidentally bumped a civilian a 5 state all points bulletin happened.   -Motorist AI is horrendous. I experienced huge traffic jams in some areas of the city which made some missions impossible to complete.  -Buggy: Had dual Cassandras and Burkes when I did the last of their personal missions, boats spawing on land, cars I needed to steal blowing up for no apparent reason before I could get to them. Disappearing icons - being told to go talk to so and so (while doing racket earning missions) and not being able to as the icons didn&#39;t appear on the map. My &#39;GPS&#39; path displayed would bug out occasionally turning into some super wide path that was impossible to follow, and many more.  -Unless you&#39;re a completionist, there&#39;s zero replay value. As stated above, racket earnings missions are extremely tedious and that alone is reason for me not to want to touch this game again.  -Locations get reused. &#39;Hey kill a pimp here..&#39; 30 minutes later, hey the boss is so dumb he went back to the same location the pimp was at. Kill him there.&#39; With so many locations possible, this is just pure laziness.  -Different endings but really doesn&#39;t feel like it means much as the endings are the end. What happened to &#39;open world games&#39; letting the player continue playing after the main story is finished? This game could be so much more..  -DLC: First DLC, through free, offered outfits that should have shipped with the game.  tl;dr Good game if you&#39;re a &#39;one and done&#39; player. If you&#39;re looking for replay value I&#39;d wait and see what future patches and/or DLC offer. As of now I can&#39;t recommend the game. It&#39;s buggy, should have never shipped with a 30 fps lock for PC players, and feels more hollow than it&#39;s predecessor.   *review edited to reflect release of first DLC*

Even forgiving the terrible ai this game is a technical mess. 30 fps lock it&#39;s only the beginning of this game issues, there&#39;s a constant &#39;fog&#39; that really kills your view distance, everything is upscaled, no real native 1080p or higher, there are glitches everywhere, shadows popping in and out, and sunlight appearing and disappearing. Definetly WAIT for this game to be fixed before buying it

Review after 9 hours. I do not plan to continue. And the review mostly focuses on the negatives.   Mafia III had a rough start with the 30FPS lock which can make alot of people get negative feelings toward a game and see bad because they&#39;re looking for it. But I really like to keep an open and positive mind on a game unless it forces me to stop, Mafia III did that. The story and setting in this game can be a reason to play it, from what I&#39;ve seen the story is quite good with interesting characters, but the story won&#39;t save a game because its a game and not a movie. The setting is of course what makes a Mafia game and its nice to see a 1960&#39;s world with all of its amazing music. Too bad that the game was advertised as having this amazing New Bordeaux city but for me, it kinda feel&#39;s boring and unmemorable.   That brings me nicely into the open wold gameplay... unless after 9 hours I havent unlocked the &#39;real game&#39;, its terrible. You can not get a haircut, can&#39;t at least change clothes, you can&#39;t even customize cars or even store them, there are set few cars you can call after you&#39;ve unlocked them by progressing through the story. All the open world does is let&#39;s you pick which order you want do complete your objectives. Mafia II literally had more &#39;open world stuff&#39; than Mafia III. Mafia II suffered from not being open world, Mafia III I don&#39;t think would suffer if it was linear. Mafia III could have been something interesting, it has such a potential for a GTA-like, open world game but set in 60&#39;s, but it feels very much like just another &#39;generic open world game&#39; with no soul. Gameplay and world feel stiff and with terrible physics and with repetetive open world tasks you need to do. I&#39;d love to have a world I feel like I live in like Mafia II, not the generic open world game world with nothing to do in.   What else we got... gunplay is quite nice, driving is much more arcadey than mafia 2 and I&#39;m personally not into that, I liked the realism of slower and heavier old cars. Stealth is fine... quite a nice addition where you can chose if you want to stab everyone or go guns blazing, both work and are pretty much equally as fun so when stealth goes wrong, shooting is still an option. And stealth would be great if not for the absoluteley awful AI that will not see you when you stand in front of them (trying to play into racism that black people are harder to spot in the dark or what?), or when you LITERALLY STAB SOMEONE IN FRONT OF THEM,  https://youtu.be/hquqaGIR5SU   Aside from the 30fps lock, the graphics look fine... as long as its not daylight  http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=778470153  The reflections in this game are garbage and day lightning makes me ill, shaders break sometimes. Really, games that are pre-alpha can look better than Mafia III and thats complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. I paid for a AAA game and not early acess. In other situations its quite alright, the facial animations for an example are really nice.   Then theres other stuff, the glitches that you can find everywhere,   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZokdmzvDGA  The extreme lack of polish this game is really pushies it over the line into hate territory for me. While playing you constantly run into a new bug every few minutes and it gets really distracting, like someone poking you once being alright but poking you once every minute would make you go crazy. I could have have rated it &#39;ok&#39;, as buy for a lower price when it comes and play this game that doens&#39;t really feel like Mafia II but a kind of generic open world game. But all this lack of polish and abundance of glitches, bugs and all other annoyances push me to say. Don&#39;t get it.  Its my opinion, I&#39;d play it if it was some sub at least 20euro game after all of the glitches are fixed. Right now I only wish I could refund...

Alright. So i have decided to not play this game past 2 hours just in case this fps fix ever gets released. And if it does, i want to have 1 hour left to test it. So here is my thoughts on the game after playing the first 2 missions, and i took the time to get out of my car and look at some textures, some animations, and stuff like that. Just to get a quick first impression of what this game is.  I run GTX 1080 rig with the lastest nVidia drivers, basically a PC that runs games like GTA V &amp;amp; The Division all maxed out in over 60fps.  The first thing i notice is that this game can not run in window borderless, it&#39;s either windowed or fullscreen, which is the second hint that this company had no plans of making a good pc version of this game, the first hint was the fps cap. Neither 2k or Hangar13 said anything about a fps cap, until the game was released, when pc gamer wrote an article on it. Then the popular youtuber totalbiscuit started asking questions, and that&#39;s when 2k made a statement.  This statement does not specify anything other than that they know the game is running in 30 fps and that higher fps will come soon.  They do not say how many fps or what soon means . But it is likely they are trying to keep people playing and hoping, so that they pass their 2 hour steam refund mark.  It makes absolutely no sense to release a game in this state if they knew how to avoid it. No sense at all. So i will take all they say with a few hundred grains of salt.  Releasing a game to reviewers, the very people that are there to critizise your product, in a state that, in their words, will be fixed &#39;very soon&#39;. Yeah right.. Very logical.   One thing that does make sense however is why this game had a review embargo.  TBH this game seems unfinished. The graphics looks like they are at least 5 years old. The city and the scale looks really good, but it looks like the entire game is upscaled.  This is a game that is not worth the price they are currently asking , not even close. I will put a hold on my refund atm, and see if a fix will arrive, but for those of you who are on the fence about buying this game, i would wait. It is a bad pc port, almost without any work gone into it.  In short:   +Narrative and story seems good +Absolutely incredible soundtrack  -Can&#39;t bind extra mouse buttons to anything -Rear view mirror has terrible draw distance -30 fps cap -Really low res textures all over the place -Looks like upscaled graphics -Horrible shadow draw distance on some objects   This is what i can remember at the top of my head. This is not worthy of a triple A PC release. Even if the game was running at 60fps, this does not look like a PC game with this price tag. So wait until it&#39;s on at least 50% sale.  It saddens me a bit to say this, because i had hopes for this game, i added it to my wishlist last December. And was looking forward to enjoying this game for the next few weeks until civilization VI releases. If it wasn&#39;t for the steam refund system, i would have felt robbed right now.  TBH this game has issues i don&#39;t think they will fix anytime soon, there will be plenty of fanboys saying i&#39;m wrong about this, that a fix is just around the corner. But i can&#39;t see it happening. Maybe a 60fps fix is coming within the next week or so, maybe 2 weeks. But that will still make the game look washed out.  This review might change completely if they do something drastic.    EDIT:   Thanks to user :  Butcher of Blaviken , i&#39;m now adding some information to this review. After i wrote this review, 2K released another statement which reads:   We currently have a patch running here at the studio that includes 30, 60, and unlimited frames-per-second options in the video menu, among other improvements for the PC version of Mafia III. We re verifying the patch now to ensure everything is working as expected. If everything goes well, we expect the update to go live this weekend.     EDIT 2:   This game is much worse than i thought. I have seen a lot of videos today showing hundreds of serious bugs and glitches. From the looks of it, this game is far worse than watch_dogs was/is.  So now i have absolutely no hope left that this game will ever be fixed, if you want to see, just search for &#39;Let&#39;s Break the Mafia 3 AI&#39; &amp;amp; &#39;mafia 3 gameplay bugs&#39;, and stuff like that on google and youtube and a lot of videos will show you how bad this game really is.  So i just refunded it. This is totally unacceptable, and 2K should have known better. And i usually defend 2K as they release a lot of quality content. But this is the first title made by Hangar13, and i can safely say they were not up for the task.

So, I went into this game more hype than I was for GTA V, since Mafia 2 is a masterpiece in my opinion, a genuinely timelesss looking game with a pretty incredible story and a beautiful setting. This game genuinely turned me off of Mafia. I don&#39;t give a hoot about the 30fps lock, it&#39;s still sufficiently smooth, but..  Here&#39;s some of the things I find annoying, from a Mafia 2 perspective.  -The game plays like a movie. Half of my playtime thus far has been cutscenes. Decent story, but holy ♥♥♥♥ I didn&#39;t expect to learn every minute detail of what Clay had for breakfast. Were the eggs runny? Was the sausage overdone? Coming up next in our next exciting episode. -The AI is in fact, bad. In the initial shootout, a guard ran back and forth in front of me, saying &#39;This is a massacre.&#39; on a 2 second loop. It&#39;d be funny if it didn&#39;t happen every room. -The cars are actually pretty fantastic, but there&#39;s no option to stealth steal a car. That gets old. -Cops don&#39;t like you. You exist. You are now wanted. -AI traffic drives around with hoods, trunks, and random doors open. That&#39;s jarring as all get-out. -I get a weird bug where glass just floats in the street randomly. Why? Iunno. -This game plays like a bad GTA IV mod. Picture in Picture on the rear view mirror has no AA. People in cars have no animations. The rear view mirror looks like playing Driver 2 on the original Playstation. -The &#39;Peds call the cops&#39; mechanic is more broken than it&#39;s worth. You can literally just waltz up and one hit them. They rarely seek out a payphone. -The cutscenes look WAY better than the actual game does.  For having held Mafia 2 in such insane regard, y&#39;all really dropped the dang ball on this one. Fix yourselves.  More playtime edit:  I thought this game -might- get a little better after a few hours, but spoilers, it didn&#39;t.  Here&#39;s some more irritating stuff that I learned about the game:  -The whole game feels cut and paste. The mission structure is the same throughout the whole game. Go into this district. Kill these idiots. Destroy this stuff. Kill this racket leader. Rinse and repeat twice. Kill the district leader. Give it to a ♥♥♥♥♥y underboss. What variety? Even on missions that were showcased at E3 and other trade shows had their balls cut off. The main mission showcased, with the underground firefight that showcased getting intelligence and planning your approach ISN&#39;T IN THE MAIN GAME.  -The cutscenes and the story It actually did lessen up, there&#39;s a lot more free play time after the first few hours, but this game is still crap. There&#39;s little story to speak of.  -The customization What customization? It&#39;s supposedly finally coming as &#39;free DLC&#39; but I doubt it, real bad.   -The cars They all do roughly the same speed, rapid acceleration to 35mph, shift, okay accel to 50, shift, meh accel to 70, shift, hit whatever that car&#39;s limit is. Why? However, they did keep the moving windshield wipers from Mafia 2, which is neat, and even has the radio go static when you enter a carpark or go into a tunnel, which is a rad little detail.  -The AI THIS IS A MASSACRE  -The FPS patch This ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off, really bad. When it came out, it redid the complete control scheme without explaining the changes or -why the control scheme needed to be changed-. Why? Cuz. These developers SUCK.

Since i played this game a whole lot, i changed my opinion on the game.  As before: the one interesting thing is the revenge story, which features racism and has a cool django unchained like flair to it (black folk facing racism and stuff).  But damn the gameplay is tedious and repetitive. I forced myself playing this game for so long, hoping things would vary a little bit along the line. But i was soooo wrong.  You basicly do the same thing over and over: 1. Drive to contact 2. learn about a person 3.Kill or interrogate a dude, destroy crates 4. Lure the mentioned person out 5. Kill that person  Thats all you do as long as you play the game. There is no fast travel or anything and you have to drive around from point to point which can take a bit depending where you go....probably to lengthen the game.  The only fun i had was when i went nuts....drove to a point, killed the contact with a single headshot...and quickly escaped. The police isnt chasing you anyway even if you speed right past them.  Unlike in Mafia 2, you cant change clothes or lincence plates to become incognito, you cant change clothes at all. When you are seen commiting a crime, you punch or shoot the witness running to the telephone and thats it...nothing happened...if someone sees you shooting the witness, just kill the new one and drive away without a care in the world.  I Really REALLY wanted this game to be good....i thought the southern revenge story full of racism and stuff was more interesting then gta, more bound in reality...but this game is not worth it.  I recommend playing mafia 2 or GTAV; GTA V is the open world action king and will remain so because it has enough variety to keep you entertaint till the end.  Mafia 3 is entertaining the first 2 hours till you find out the stuff you did till then is all you will do for the rest of the game.  Dont buy this game, wait for a cheap sale if you are interested, but dont pay the price it is currently charged for.

***Please note this is purely my opinion, you are free to disagree with me but keep it civil. Abusive comments and personal attacks will be deleted.***  Pros:  + Excellent cutscenes + Excellent story + Good music selection + Weapons sound realistic and meaty + Setting the driving to simulation feels really good  Cons:  - Repetitive missions (Go here, kill/destroy something, come back, repeat!) - Poorly optimized - Muddy, grainy textures (Looks like upscaled 720p textures) - Clunky mouse and keyboard controls - Can&#39;t rebind keys to extra mouse buttons - Can&#39;t jump! - When using the mouse to look around while driving it constantly resets itself to the default position - Moving around cover isn&#39;t as smooth and easy when compared to other cover based shooters - Multiple crashes to desktop  Verdict:  An excellent story hampered by some performance issues along with questionable and annoying design decisions.  If you are willing and able to overlook the many small issues then I urge you to at least try it for yourself because the game is definitely not terrible but for me personally I wouldn&#39;t recommend it... Not at full price anyway.  I would hold off buying it for for now. Wait for a sale as there are too many annoying issues bringing down what could potentially be a really great game.  If I had to give it a rating I&#39;d score it a 6.5 out of 10 (slightly above average)   ***UPDATE*** A patch has been announced which should come out on the weekend. So long as it corrects many of the minor issues you can expect this review to change... Fingers crossed.  ***UPDATE 2*** After spending a little more time with the game (went over 2 hours... woops!) I have edited some of the pros and cons and adjusted my score upwards slightly, If the coming patch adresses things like frame rate, textures and keybinds I will adjust it higher again and possibly reccomend the game.  ***UPDATE 3*** A patch has been released that corrects the 30 fps lock and the game feels a lot smoother and responsive, however all other issues listed still remain along with some weird graphical bugs like objects disappearing and what feels like more frequent crashes which weren&#39;t present before... I have updated both my review and score a second time and this will likely be my final verdict and update.

Broken out of the box, Quality control dropped the ball on this one.  You might have heard about the fps and graphics gripe (not to miss in most reviews) but what baffles me  is that the keymapping seems to break the game, leaving you stuck in a mission where the game tells you to press (key) and or (keypad) controller and nothing happens..   Tried out to reset all keysettings, and got it working: make sure you have no double keybinds and or conflicts. so if you use arrow keys walking dont use them for driving, this seems to mess things up  assigning keysettings to a mouse doesnt seem to work unless you can program mouse to emulate keyboard keys.  music and story are quite entertaining, even the shooting has a nice feel and look to it. couple this with nice driving but lackluster graphics its still a mixed bag, although the story is very compelling and well written.  After several hours in, i can say the story is still very compelling, i got drawn to the characters and just can&#39;t wait how it develops and see how my actions influence the game, the voice acting is superb, even the smallest details when you hear some people talk to eachother when sneaking around have me stop and listen, same as with the radio sometimes you just have to drive around to hear it.  Now the only thing that is getting to me is how long it takes to get to a cutscene to progress the story, the repetive nature and major flaw of this game seems to creep in, find object bug phone, find person, kill person and or interogate person, sneak or shoot (my favorites).  Although each in different settings but if the settings are the only thing to endure the time consuming repetive task of progress then i don&#39;t know i want to continue and even finish the game.  I realise all games have something repetive yet when it becomes to obvious it wears down my enthusiasm and i get bored, putting the game down and shelfing it.  It&#39;s better than mad max game but way behind the last grand theft auto or batman arkham asylum in the gameplay department, which just seem to have a bit more diversity in the long run to make you want to finish the game.  btw, i never in the 20 hours managed to take one of those brutal finishers, playing with mouse and keyboard, never saw the option pop up or just shoot them in the head as enemies can take quite a few shots before going down, a bit to much imho when you got authentic storytelling.   but i&#39;m shelfing it for now, repetive threshold has been reached... very dissapointing for such a game

Please just check this comparison of Mafia 3 vs Mafia 2 from 2010:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixlszwKVVP0   Story is the strongest point of this game. Just love brutality and language. But missions are repetitive with a lot of long, boring driving in between. Fast travel would be welcome here. Also AI is very stupid to the point when enemies are looking at the walls for 30 seconds from 20 cm distance. Is this Blair Witch Project ??? Graphics mostly are ok but also nothing like we seen in trailers or devs gameplays. The sky, water and grass are the weakest points. Also there is some serious issue whith water and cars slightly glowing at night. Combat is good but also very &#39;bare bons&#39;. The only &#39;special&#39; thing about it is you die fast if you do not try to be stealth or use covers. Cover system is good but sometimes clunky and hard to &#39;manage&#39;. Driving is different and games like GTA, Driver or even FarCry done it better. I didn&#39;t encounter any crashes. There are FPS drops, some textures has low resolution and light/shadow glitches.Game was locked on 30 FPS without informing players before release day. This is unacceptable on PC and just outrageous. Overall game works - I7 4770K and GTX 980ti. But there are many people with crashes and games not running at all. There is nothing special about this game that makes you want to play all day long.

I never thought that someday I will be so disapointed in Mafia game. ..will watch all the cutscenes on youtube, cause it&#39;s a waste of time to play it through. Degraded in every way possible from previous Mafia titles. It&#39;s even waste of time to write this opinion, cause none of us still plays it or considers to buy.

Pro&#39;s:  - uuuhhh.. - Lincoln himself looks well animated - Facial expressions - Music - Some night, rain+lighting settings  Con&#39;s:  - Bought it as pre-order (thanks to this game, I&#39;ll think twice before buying pre-order stuff again) - Bought it with Season Pass (fml) - The graphics look average (like other ppl said, copy pasted console port) - DESIGNING MISTAKE IN 100% OF THE CARS! SRSLY, WHERE ARE THE TANK NOZZLES? As there are gas stations, those cars have to be fueled with something.. It ain&#39;t air for sure.. - Repetitive gameplay (like really repetitive.. Assassins Cree* Style) - &#39;Open World&#39; is heavily restricted (can&#39;t plow through bushes, MANY buildings have only 1 or 2 entrances/exits, main gates to facilities aren&#39;t accessible by foot, but when you ram a car through, you got yourself a new entrance) - Lifeless surrounding AI - Stupid AI in general (1.) it&#39;s more fun to rush through your missions with a knife, the AI won&#39;t notice you anyway :D 2.) in bars for example, in which only white ppl are allowed, just sneak to the barman, knock him out and steal his money.. The guests are A: not even slightly interested in the fact that a black man knocked out the barman or B: just stand up, scream and try calling the police)   I really feel sorry for all the guys and girls who pre-ordered this half baked console port, as there are just so many things wrong with this game, I think they won&#39;t be able to fix. Still, I payed much money, so I will complete the game + DLC at some point, but I regret it in any way.  If I would be a developer, I wouldn&#39;t be happy with this product I made..  Can&#39;t recommend, sadly

At the time of writing this review, I simply cannot recommend the game.  Terrible technical issues, a framerate stuck hovering between 30 and 40, disappearing textures, physics bugs, and more. The story isn&#39;t worth sticking with the nonsense that is this game&#39;s technical failure on almost every level.

+ Neat cutscenes + Soundtrack + Shooting mechanics are okay, but the ridiculous easiness of &#39;whistle + silent takedowns&#39; almost makes that a non-issue  - Graphics: pathetic draw distance, night-time missions, low-res textures, everything is very much 2012 - Physics, or rather lack of it - Car damage: generic, lacking any kind of appeal. Expecting Mafia I level of destruction? Nope, think NFS. - Driving feels very off, cars are basically undistiguishable from each other - Big sandbox; very dull world. Copy-pasted building interiors are supposed to add to the experience, but grow old very fast. NPC&#39;s are obsessed with racial issues. I&#39;d venture to say that the universally lambasted Watch_Dogs fared far better in regards of creating a living breathing game world: not because it was so good, it was that much better. Yes, they actually butchered the late 60&#39;s America to death. This is not GTA: London 1969 3D. Euro Truck Driver&#39;s world got heaps more personality than this trainwreck. - Grotesquely Evil White People.  A technologically backwards and soulless take on a once-great franchise. GTA V has been out for 3 years, and this doesn&#39;t come close in any regard whatsoever. Not necessarily &#39;refund level&#39; disappointing, but very disappointing nonetheless.  The &#39;in-your-face&#39;, obnoxious pre-game disclaimer, doesn&#39;t add to the experience either, to say the very least. I don&#39;t like my mediocre $60 games coming with the head writer, Haden Blackman&#39;s, take on racial issues, or rather any politicking whatsoever.  There&#39;s Twitter and there are supposedly AAA games. No need to intertwine the two.  Especially so when the end-result is basically a slightly polished turd.

30 FPS cap aside the graphics in general are awful, view distance is terrible (cars pop up so close you can’t avoid hitting them if you are driving fast), the city in the distance looks blurry, textures are awful and look obviously up scaled. I’m playing at 1440p on an NVidia 980 and 4790k @4.66. Everything maxed out, didn’t notice any frame drops. The game would look good if they released it 5 years ago.  The AI is incredibly dumb, can sneak up on them by walking up to them from any angle practically, shooting sections so far are basically galleries of dumb AI, definitely quantity over quality. Bit in the prologue where you have to get to a boss, and it just keeps spewing unlimited AI unless you advance forward.  In less than 2 hours the game has crashed to desktop twice, and froze once requiring an Alt+F4, a further time I got to an objective and it didn’t trigger the next cut scene, so had to restart the game, as it hadn’t saved my progress I had to replay the previous 10 minutes. The one saving grace is the story, and cut scenes especially are very well detailed, with fantastic animations and voice acting, just a shame the rest of the game isn’t rendered to the same quality.   I’ve played 115 minutes and just finished the prologue, going to refund now on steam and buy it from a key reseller once it&#39;s patched a bit, dev’s don’t deserve much for putting this standard of game out.

Really bad Port!  -30FPs lock, dropping down to 27-29 while driving. -Blurry text and textures. -Before starting the game, you have a choice to turn on auto Aim. -You can only set the Graphics settings in the launcher and after the long intro cutscenes. No options menu in the main Title menu. -There are sound glitches when setting your audio to a higher sample rate. -Bad mouse smoothing in menu, but quite decent in game. -There is an FOV option but increasing it somehow decrease input text size.  I&#39;m really hyped for this game but they sabotaged the PC version (maybe gave us a beta build or something). Can&#39;t play for more than 2 minutes with the mouse and keyboard as it gives me migraine. They should have delayed the PC version when they clearly know it&#39;s not ready yet. Feels like playing afully priced Early Access game with Season Pass and micro DLC&#39;s.

Game feels like a downgrade from Mafia II  Pros:    Cutscenes facial detail is really good    New weapon mechanic feels good.    References towards Mafia II and events.    Map is well designed    Good voice acting    Story is ok    Spoiler:   Joe&#39;s alive?!     Cons:    Police AI, unlike it&#39;s predecessor the cops are just dumb, no level system(stars) and no realism like the last game(robbery/speeding ect.)    Where&#39;s the customization? Garages, clothing stores, ect?    To many characters = not caring for them. Should&#39;ve focused more on the Father &amp;amp; Donovan. I didn&#39;t feel emotionally connected to the decisions I made in this game like I had before(Mafia II)    Repetitive, doing the same thing over and over again for each territory = boredom.    Dumb settings. Opening the menu to decide for Lethal vs Non Lethal and FPS selection is probably the dumbest ♥♥♥♥ I&#39;ve seen in a long time.    Textures/Looks. The game looks like trash 90% of the time, the textures looked stretched and unnatural, except for in cut scenes.    Limited detail, unlike Mafia II, this game is just the game and that&#39;s it, there&#39;s no small details like eating, getting gas, or interacting with anything.    Limited car selection.    Game runs like ♥♥♥♥ across the board, regardless of setting most users don&#39;t average above 45 fps.   Conclusion: This game had so much potential but in the end failed. It&#39;s repetitive and has a very limited replay ability because of it.   Don&#39;t buy this game, just go replay Mafia II. This game is a downgrade.

Ignoring the fact that this once had a 30fps lock on it at launch. The game still runs like ♥♥♥♥. Very poor port from devs. Only getting about 45fps on a 1070 at medium settings at 1080p. And even with everything turned off and on the lowest settings it cannot reach the desired 60fps constantly.   Graphics are a big downside to most people but i couldn&#39;t care as long as other major things like draw distance are fixed first.  Considering the massive ♥♥♥♥♥torm that the pc community give developers when the release sub par ports you would think that developer would try to lift their game and actually produce a good pc port for once. But so far it looks like doing the right thing is just too hard now days.  Sad to see the only game i was looking forward to this year be another game that wont be ready until another 6 months of patches.  Edit: Game cannot run for more thant 10-20 mins without crashing for me. Performance wise i have changed settings everywhere possible and i get 60 fps when there is nothing/no one around. But as soon as i get into town im lucky to keep a solid 40 fps.

GAME CRASH, seriously?? slower than mafia2 and crash? ==== Updated - Found more bugs - Target mark is missing on map and u have to restart the game, happened once - Car driving AI is buggy, they drive like crazy sometime even cop&#39;s cars - Background Music was broken, once. - Jacket dances itself sometime - Car bump into (literally) a house for no reason, once - Traffic jammed itself, sometime - Cant turn on the car engine, unless u re-enter the car, once. - Real life navigation system is more reliable than the one in game, it direct me to drive through a bridge then ask me to do u-turn in the middle.  For the gameplay Maybe too soon to say, reverse story telling is kind of anonying.  Updated #2: After 6 hours gameplay kind of boring now. Driving experience and FPS are not as good as mafia1~2 or even GTA and i just get around 2x~3x FPS in gameplay after removed the FPS limit. I used to enjoy driving with my xbox analog controller, but not much fun with this title, not sure it&#39;s FPS, the AI, or the physic.    The in-game Menu is not user friendly, the scrolling is so anonlying, why make it complicated while it need to be simple and functional. Accidentally set a destination all the time on map page. Once u set a wrong destination, and u need to figure out how to set back the mission destination. There is no much details in the map... just road, sections, mission target..   And I can find more bugs than fun in this game. HIGHLY RECOMMAND to wait, for bug fixing, for sale, for mafia 4...  === Suggestion to hanger &amp;amp; 2k If the game is not ready, just push back the release date. There is no reason to destory this title by catching up the stupid project timeline. As fans, money is ready for the game, you are the one who refused to take it.  It didn&#39;t match the quality of mafia series, more like watch dog with ton of bugs. To be honest, as a software engineer, with that amount of bugs, very likely they did it so wrong at the beginning. With that fundation, I doubt they can fix it (but not re-do the whole thing) without sacrifice anything, like performance (or they already did).   https://youtu.be/6KUVeGtJHfg    https://youtu.be/pReSEgmj5bU

Pains me to say this, I know the game is locked at 30FPS, that is not my main issue, the issue is that the game does hold at 30 but it stutters, it stutters badly, I do not know if it is because I have a 144hz monitor and I am noticing it more, its not playable in this state for me, such a shame. The game graphics are ok, not 2016 worthy and here&#39;s another kicker, it seems upscaled from 720p which could be the blur everyone is reporting, people are asking for an AA option, but realistically only a texture pack is going to fix it.  This is clearly a game for consoles that has been ported at the last min for PC with no love, care or attention, truly shocking, Hanger 13 should be ashamed of themselves right now, I would...  UPDATE 09 10 2016: (I will be fair to the game and update my review as development continues) They have now unlocked the FPS, even with my system I can only reach around 60 fps drops to 50 in parts which is fine, further more by capping at 60 with vsync on all the stuttering I experienced at 30fps has gone, not perfect but not as bad. I will not continue with the campaign at 720p upscaled graphics lol...   i7 5960x / Titan X (2) Maxwel / 64gDDR4 / Win 10 64bit

I really like the main character and the people associated with him. I love the setting (even the bayou lol). The soundtrack is pretty damn good (especially for a bunch of songs i&#39;ve never heard before). But the mandatory side activities get dull after the 2nd district you take over, turning the awesome setting/characters into a pretty boring experience. The story missions are fun and well done imo. The first major person you take out was in a pretty interesting place that i enjoyed very much. Also... this game just isn&#39;t optimized very well at all... there is barely any difference between medium and high. With a 970 and FX-8350 i can&#39;t even get the game to run at 60fps/1080p on medium, but the rec specs has a 780 listed -_-. They tackled a touchy subject, had the perfect setting/cast of characters but fell very short on the gameplay side of things. I will keep playing because it was a gift along with the season pass from gmg. But i&#39;d suggest waiting for a huge sale or just avoid entirely. Either way, you won&#39;t miss much. Maybe Hangar 13 will polish their next game some more before releasing it.  **UPDATE**  After finishing this game, i must say that John Donovan is officially my favorite video game character of all time. The dude is the pure, uncut definition of awesome. If he gets his own game, I&#39;ll buy it just for his character.

  First I want to clear I buy the game from cd keys and that&#39;s why is shown for free   The developers requested feedback, here is some problems that must be fixed on the pc.  First there is some very strange blur filter on the pc version. If I lower the AA setting to low the game still have that blur. This filter must be toggle on or off and a sharpen option must be introduced, like in the witcher 3 and deus ex mankind divided. The textures in the game especially on the environment are very low res and for the pc high textures option is needed the current looks like are made for 720p.  Ui scaling is also a must. The ability to switch settings ingame not only from the launcher. Things like tessellation and nvidia gameworks will be a plus. Personally I think the pc version was handle very poorly. It&#39;s sad because mafia was a PC francaise.Similar problems in 2016 are not aceptable in any AAA title. I watch the preview gameplay and I love what I saw. I pre order it an and the season pass. Now I&#39;m very disappointed by the technical problems in this promising game.  My advice is wait until all the problems are fixed. The game have a lot of bugs and glitches like the lighting system, draw distance, textures and so on. I will not be surprised if the problems are fixed months after release like Arkham Knight. Until then wait for sale.  Current problems  - blurred overall picture (filter or AA solution)  - Very low res textures no option to switch to hi res version.  - 30 fps lock on pc (unacceptable)  - weather system and lighting dosent work corectly. (cloud shadows move extremely fast)  - physics and animation glitches  - Resolution problems abouve 1080p  - absence of UI scaling  Video samples of the problems   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZokdmzvDGA    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g24KExuSBMk    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXNeDQ4bkGw   Very poor version I dont recomend in current state.

This did not feel like a Mafia game to me...  Good story, I&#39;ll give them that, but that&#39;s basically where it ends. I literally kept killing the same guys over and over. There was hardly any challenge to the game, if you played the game stealthy. Just crouch behind something, whistle, and kill them when they are close. *YAWN*  Also, a lot of sidemissions are bugged. * Steel a boat ---&amp;gt; No boat there. * Steal the truck ---&amp;gt; No truck there.  Honestly, the bugs I can deal with. Let&#39;s face it, almost every game has bugs, but the overall experience I got from this game, is just really bad.  To me, this game was a complete let down.

For a game I&#39;ve been waiting for for 6 years, it&#39;s dreadful - There was close to 0 storyline as most of it is revealed with the whole game following a repetitive line of missions with the odd mission which isn&#39;t &#39;Take down the racket boss&#39;. Never the less I played the game through because it had the title &#39;Mafia 3&#39; when the game isn&#39;t even come close to being worthy of being called that.

I&#39;m going to talk about the storymode and its flaws now: The only thing that holds a story in this game are the cutscenes which can be seen as completely irrelivant to the gameplay, let me explain. So i ignored the fact that they gave us, the pc people a unfinished port. My love for Mafia 2 brought me in a state of disbelieve. Ignoring the glitches and half-baked framerate I went in the game just to get that feeling of rising to the top and feeling like a true mob boss. But the way the missions take place leave so much to be desired. In the main AND side missions you are doing the same ffing thing over and over and over again without the feeling of progress.  I have 12 hours on record and I don&#39;t know how, I don&#39;t feel like I have achieved anything. The first few hours were amazing but the rest is starting to feel like a waste of time. Now I don&#39;t know how far I am in the story but I do know that I have lost interest in driving from point A to B and kill a bunch of people, then driving back to point A to tell them I succeeded in killing a bunch of people. This game made me wish for a quick travel option..  Am I really the boss in this game or am I still a puppet with strings being played?  Haven&#39;t we learned from far cry 4 that the hero is often just a slave to the side characters? How (in)appropriate for this game, atleast we got to shoot them kkk members so it&#39;s worth am I right?  Why can&#39;t I buy clothes? Oh you are going to add &#39;costumes&#39; in a later patch? Which you probably have to acces via the start menu just like switching between lethal an non lethal kills eh?  Why can&#39;t I go to a car dealer and buy cars? I get a set of cars picked for me? For free? Jolly good, such choice.  Why don&#39;t the police mind me speeding? Do the police even give tickets? What is their use other then being just another gang. Why is the entire police system a downgrade from mafia 2?  Why are the lockpick mechanics a step down from mafia 2? I could see the freaking lock in that game, even opened cars that way. Now i just bash a window and jump in gta style.. is it cause I&#39;m black?  What happend to the licenseplate system? Yo, that was cool. Why can&#39;t I buy a safehouse? All this money, well not really cause you run out of ammo and adrenaline shots so quick that you spend most of your money on it. Because you keep dying cause you can&#39;t stand waiting in a corner and whistling until the dumbass ai comes to get killed by you. I wanted to buy houses and fill my garage with cars. It makes the game more personal.  An ingredient to succes for games is putting the player and the main character in different scenario&#39;s, this keeps the player interested. Wolfenstein the new order is a great example of this. But even Mafia 2 did this, in the game you lived with your family, stayed with your friend, got a new appartement and stayed in jail. That&#39;s progression via different scenario&#39;s I expect to see from a open world game in 2016. It adds value and weight to the story you are moving through.  In mafia 3 tho, I don&#39;t feel like I&#39;m the character that I am playing. It started of really good by putting me in a situation building up the story but in the next hour or so I&#39;ve killed so many people that I&#39;ve emotionaly become disconnected to him and his revenge story. He has one simple goal but decides to go unnecessarily overboard with his plan just like this review. It leaves no desire in getting sidetracked and forgetting about the main missions. Now I just want to do the main missions because I am hoping that there is atleast a bit of light at the end of the tunnel. I was hoping to play mafia 3 and not a serious version of Saints Row(xbox 360). The missions are repetitive and thus you will get bored of this game before you finish it.

~ 4hrs in; Update: 25 hrs in, after first patch   Pros  - Good Story and Presentation (Soundtrack is on point, Interesting Characters, Voice Acting, good Cutscenes) - Keyboard + Mouse works perfectly (driving is still more fun with a controller) - car behaviour in &#39;Simulation&#39; mode (lets you choose wether you want realism or a more arcade way of driving) - Gun fights (variety of Weapons, Gun behaviour, responsive and direct controls with mouse) - the city is crowded and feels &#39;alive&#39;  Cons  - 30fps (???) Update: fixed with patch - I had 4 crashes so far (the game just goes back to desktop, no error message or anything; Update: no crashes since patch) - Physics of objects and bodies look clunky sometimes - Graphicglitches with lighting, also Characters have a weird greenish glow on skin and clothes (could be my graphic settings, I dont know) - bad performance optimization - Update: very repetitive mission design (story and optional missions) - Update: missing a lot of little details which we know from M1+M2 (look at the comparison videos on youtube) - absolutely horrible AI (mostly exposed when you choose the stealth approach) - engines sound more like modern V6/V8 rather than the old muscle cars - I dont like the UI  All in all its a good game, but the technical issues are annoying. The PC port feels rushed and unfinished and shouldn&#39;t have been released like that. Update: After the first patch and more hrs of gameplay, its still a thumbs down. I dont really mind the weird graphic glitches or the blurryness or the horrible textures or how bad this game is running on somewhat good PCs. What really kills it for me is the mission design and the lack of those little details which I loved in Mafia 1 and Mafia 2. Why would you remove the speedlimiter? Why do cops not care when you pass them with 200km/h? Why do they shoot on sight, instead of arresting you, giving you a ticket? And the list goes on and on.... At least it was not 60€ like some other crappy games.

Here we go, my first review ever.  I were superhyped about Mafia 3. I&#39;ve played the first and secod countless of hours and enjoyed almost every minute of them. Sadly, the third did not meet my expectations. Not at all. Not even close  Though the story and cut scenes are very good it does not compensate the extremely bad game. This is nothing like Mafia or Mafia 2. This is some kind of gta remake in the sixties. All you do is kill a lot of people whitout any meaning.  The game is so poorly optimized so it will most certenailly lag or in other ways not work.  The mission was fun, maybe once or twice. The 38th time you did it, not so much. In Mafia 2 there were a lot of different missions, like robbing a place with stamps and infiltrating a hotel. This was just the same two or three missions all the time.   I cannot recomend this game to anyone, sadly. I love the first two game so much. Besides Ocarina of time, I would say that Mafia 2 is my absolute favourite game. So if you liked Mafia 2, do not buy this game. You&#39;ll get dissapointed.   Please bring 2k czech back for the next game.

I loved mafia II. I realy wanted this game to be as good. after taking all 3 first bosses i can&#39;t say it is... it&#39;s not a bad game, but it&#39;s not a AAA game either on 2016.   soundtruck is amazing,the art concept also nice,realy it&#39;s nice. the most thrriling part is the driving handlling, while listning to the guitars and flyin over the biutyfull bayou scenery. but thats about it.   the game is like BorderLands, go kill go fetch. and it&#39;s all repetitive, and get real easy to kill enemis stealth or if you choose to go guns blazing all the same. but it&#39;s not the worst game. it&#39;s got a story line. only problem is, that the story is as hard as the story of DoubleDragon. all family members are killed, revenge. the grafics are quite pour, yet 970 oc cant work on 60 fps, its struggel to stay above 40 on medium, and realy for no reason, for a game that looks like last gen. we&#39;ve seen a lot beter looking games like GTA V ,witcher 3 ,mad max ,assassin creed paris and london, who worked perfectly fine on high or super high on 60 fps. it&#39;s optimise poorly. the port is as bad for pc. game play is a bit fun, in the first repits. but if i could take back time i would have paid 39 on releas not a peny more. probably wait for 50% even.  forgot to add  the pointles &#39;are we cool&#39; and &#39;seems simpel enough&#39; objectives in the bayou are broken. send me to empty places where at first was what suppose to be.

gtx 1080, i5-4690k even with the FORCED 30fps cap the game still stutters and performs terribly.   Graphic settings lead a lot to be desired.   *Horrible bluring, probably some caused by FXAA which cannot be turned off beleive it or not. But most bluring comes from depth of field setting which can be turned off thank god. It blurs everything in the distance constantly.  *some blury textures, and some reasonable textures. but obvious inconsistency. *30 fps cap that doesnt even frame pace to 30 fps properly.  *no borderless window option  *launcher graphic settings do not apply to game once loaded  And yes, this does massively affect the gameplay and enjoyment level. So pople who say its all about story, etc, are missing the point about good art, and how good art/performance/tech can increase immersion and impress upon people.   THIS FEELS LIKE RUSHED TECH.

Just to start off , i&#39;m a big Mafia fan and this game was very dissapointing for me .  Here we go  Edit:I just tried to finish the game but i can&#39;t ,it&#39;s really boring because of these ♥♥♥♥♥♥ repetitive missions.   Pros:  -The story is great -Level-Design is great -Sountrack is ♥♥♥♥ing great  -The voice-acting is great  -The facial animation are perfect  -The combat was inproved in some ways (and downgraded ...). -The collectives are great (if you know what i mean ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) .  Now we get in to the dissaponting part   really dissapointing  .  Cons: -Bad optimized (can&#39;t even hit 60 fps with my gtx 980). -Great future removed from the other games (i will link some videos to let you guys see). -Very repetitive missions (and you have to complete them to get further in to the story). -Very ugly textures and effects (there are some fixes online to make them look better). -Alot of bugs (on the level of bethesda games...). -Dumb AI  -Enemies look almost identical (i mean wtf , it&#39;s 2016 ...).

EDIT: So the fps unlocking patch has been released and behold the game can&#39;t run stable 60 fps on a 1080 GTX even, it fluctuates between 40-58 fps using the 60 fps limit and G-Sync seems to be handling it quite well. However there&#39;s till frame timing issues every now and then that cause major stuttering even if it&#39;s running at around 50 fps.  Game has three major technical issues that makes it very hard to recommend this game to anyone who has issues graphical issues.  1. 30 FPS lock, controls are very sluggish and it basically feels like playing on a console when you try to aim with the mouse, it&#39;s actually preferable to play with a controller at all times for me right now at least.  2. The lightning in the game has some very bad issues. First of all light sources have a very low view distance keep popping in. Secondly shadows seem to render on and off just by turning the camera a bit back and forth without moving yourself on certain objects.  3. THE BLUR... everything looks like someone smudged it with some acid or something, like it isn&#39;t enough that the textures look a blurry mess from the start they decide to blur it and then blur it some more! NOTE: It&#39;s mostly the anti aliasing technique (FXAA) causing this, setting it to low actually improves the graphics as long as your resolution is high enough to compensate the jaggies.  Other bugs would include some very strange physics in the game with ragdolls bouncing around as well as objects not rendering at all (Had a bunch floating stuff that I could walk into in a garage only to suddenly spawn a table underneath when I entered the car). Had a single CTD crash just as loading screen started about 1 hour into the game but then no problems for the rest of my session. Seen the exact same rendering and CTD issue on some streamers so it&#39;s a game issue.  The good part so far is that voices, lip syncing and close up models look good and the story has also been quite intriguing and fun. However the missions themselves are starting to feel very repetitive.  Will update the review as I go along but seriously why would you go some much backwards from Mafia 2 or even Mafia 1 from a technical aspect....

Let&#39;s start by saying the game in gameplay and story aspects feels great, the story is very intriguing and it is really motivating. Basically, the concept of the game is similar to that of The Godfather 2, where you hurt gangs by taking their business and make them yours, only thing there&#39;s a bigger goal in this story. The protagonist is damn strong and i like him since he seems always confident about his purpose. The combat is great, the mechanics and finishers are badass, corpses remain with bloodshed and do not disappear, blood is splattered against wall, the animations of how enemies react by being shot are similar to GTA V. That being said, the game is trash in perfomance and graphics, it is very hardware demanding for its mediocre graphics, no wonder they locked it at 30fps. I&#39;ve got a 1080 and i can barely maintain solid 60fps in open areas at 1080p &amp;amp; Ultra, if the game was nice looking i could deal with this, but it is really not. The fact that people have had to install optional graphical settings like ENB, Sweet FX and reshade is embarrassing for a fresh released AAA. I&#39;d recommend everyone to wait, because i really want to enjoy this game, but not in its actual state. I&#39;ll be adquiring a Titan X Pascal in a month i will update this review upon completion of the game asuming it&#39;s been patched significantly.

I finished the game. At the beginning i was dissapointed due to the lack of Vito Scaletta. As the game progressed, I became increasingly interested in the story, the setting, and how the game kept its mode. There were many repetitive phases in the game yet the story and the soundtrack full of good classics were enchanting and wonderful. On hard mode, the game is truly challenging. I have no regrets of playing this game, i really liked it.

No point in changing the settings before you launch the game as they dont change in game so you&#39;ll have to do it from the options menu again.  All the missions are repetative, i know all games are but when you have to repeat the same missions over and over again that isnt a quality game.  Here&#39;s the full game...  go here take this down or tail someone,  Kill or save?   come back to me,  kill this guy,   assign whoever,   kill the leader of the district  and repeat.  still nothing to do other than story missions  AI are the dumbest i have ever encountered in a game  it get really boring after an hour of play  Just wait for a sale or dont bother at all.

If you&#39;re looking to play Mafia 3 because of Mafia 2, don&#39;t buy this game. Why? Because for each territory you about to take-over there are plenty of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ side-quests in it. And you basically do the same ♥♥♥♥ over and over again for like 15-20 hours? And not just that it took me less than 30 hours just to finish the whole game without any side-quests. Plus you can&#39;t even customize your appearance or your cars (just yet). And in order to make the game more fun to play you have to buy the season pass which include 3 more missions, if only you have $20 extra to add in for your game or buy it with $30 extra if you already buy the game. Afterall I really don&#39;t recommend the game, And Mafia 3 really disappointed me. It gave me a feeling of Watch Dog game.  PS: The only part that&#39;s satisfy me is what happen to Joe.

Unfortunately I was very disappointed with this game. Let&#39;s just forget that they released the game locked at 30fps....low blow to the pc community. After they unlocked the framerate to 60, you could see even more that the game was really badly optimized. It is sometimes glitchy and I was lucky enough to never encounter any lighting issues or clip issues or gamebreaking bugs/crashes.  That said, the game actually began as a great game. Graphically is nothing special but also nothing too bad. I really enjoyed the game in the beginning, many things reminded me of the old dear first Mafia rather than the second one (which I also liked by the way). The driving was great and shooting was also a very nice feeling. Narration started very interesting and the story began like it had a lot to offer, everything was very promising. Sadly after a few hours you notice that all you have to do are repetitive tasks: damage this racket, kill this guy, steal this truck. Those are not even side missions: you need to complete these tasks to progress in the &#39;main&#39; story. Which revealed itself to be no real story at all. I was not able to finish the game because of all this nonsense. I doubt the ending would be a lightbringer. I progressed to what looks to be 75% of the main story (I checked a walkthrough with a mission list) and really can&#39;t force myself to finish it.  In a way it behaves like a Just Cause game....damage this, damage that, kill bad guys in the meantime, go around with the car etc etc.....but Just Cause has a reason to exist because it focuses exactly on that, and it does it well. Also every Just Cause had good graphics to begin with. This Mafia has no real purpose, no real identity or story, and on top of that there are all the various glitches/framerate drops and average graphics. I preordered it thinking that being 2K the publisher, it could not be THAT bad (they always released good games). Also I liked Mafia 2, it obviously it was not as good as the first Mafia, but I thought this third one would have been more or less on the same level with Mafia 2. Nope, not the case.

Mafia 3 has crashed on me multiple times , it&#39;s good that they unlocked the FPS controlls and I have unlimited but after 5 hours of game time I have exited my game only too come back and my save file was completley corrupted and wanted me too start from the begining again.  I am running this on my Alienware 15 and what I first thought was cool ( My key board flashing red and blue when I am being chased by the police) it randomly decided too freak out and flash like crazy in a multitude of colours and was causing me a mini freak out and I had too restart my computer .   there&#39;s a ton of other amusing glitches , ( charcters repeating 2 lines of dialog in a panic, people flying back with one pistol shot, random cars being on their side blocking the road , mirrors acting like fun house mirrors that are paused) Etc   The game is clearly a broken mess, and it&#39;s hard to reccomend with such an intresting and exciting story which I now have too repeat ...  wait for this game too go on sale or be fixed but that&#39;s unlikely but save your money for now, I was sadly bought into the hype by playing the previous 2 installments hoping this would be the best and It&#39;s clearly the worst quality wise.  Update: I have had my progress wiped 3 times now by corrupt saves past the point of talking too the Voice. IT IS BROKEN!

This feel like a poor wananbe GTA to be honest, loved both Mafia 1 and 2 because it had some small features who stod out and made them special.  Few things that i loved about mafia games that are missing in this: 1: Simulation mode for cars, for added difficulty. The simulation mode in Mafia 3 is arcade at best. impossible to loose control of the car.  2: Cops who care about the public safety, here they dont care if you drive 120 mph across red light in opposide side of the road. 3: Shops who serve a purpose, in mafia 1 and 2 you could get food, clothes, upgrades in shops. in Mafia 3 they are empty husk who serve no purpose.  GFX in this game looks ok from a distance, but once you get closer it looks like they stopped development before the final finish. So far the only thing i like about the game is that it is honest to history and dont try and cover up rasicm, and actualy use it to its advantage.  So far i am far from impressed and quite disapointed  Edit October 8, 11:00 BST  Cargo: Cargo crates are welted, glued and bolted to the chassis of the car/truck you drive, so when transporting moonshine or weed there is no chance of damage the good like in Mafie 1 and 2, such a shame that they cut this feature too.  A.I. : or lack of it, npc dont reach to firefight 5-10 meters from them if there is a small garden wodden fence in the way, at one point i shot 3 npc enemy on enemy territory, and 10 meters away there where another 3 enemies who kept talking and havent heard the gun shots.  Copy and paste: Starting to see the same building and building layout over and over again, they have not even bothered to change the colours on walls or anything to make them look even a tiny bit different.  Final edit October 10, 11:00 BST  Finaly completed the game and can give a final review, reason for amount of hours is lots of time afk in game.  Found a few more things that realy got to annoy me the more time i spend in the game.  1. Repedative: Do the same missions over and over again, attack a certain building in a area to lure out the leader of the area only to have to go back to exact same building after you done enough damage to lure him out, becomes realy repedative.  2. Encrease area value: When taking over a area you can increase the area value a bit by doing a side mission, this could be steal weed, moonshine or a truck. But once the area is at max, you still get the side mission icons on the map, but the area is empty and you cant do any thing there. Realy annoying that you are told you can do a mission that you cannot do because your &#39;racket&#39; value is at max.  3. Cops: Cops serve no real purpose in the game other than to annoy you and make A.I. look stupid. Killed of most of the guest in a dinner and cops where called, they never went to the dinner i stod outside off and gave up the seach, there was also 3 cops standing 30-50 meters away from diner but they could not be bothered to go there.  They dont care about you breaking every single traffic rule, and if a mobster starts shooting at you and you dont draw your weapon but run and hide, the cops will start hunting you too, but will not care about the mobster who is unloading his tommygun in your general direction no matter what he hit.   4. GFX: running at max everything 1920*1080, npc looks so bad when you get close to them, hair looks like plastic wigs, mirrors was better in the game Duke nukem from 1991. cutscenes looks almost same quality as Mafia 2.   Final Vedict:  If you like Mafia 1 and 2, then dont get this game because it is not a mafia game in my mind, they have left out all the things that made mafia 1 and 2 stand out from games like GTA or Saints Row. And even left out things that are/was standard in Mafia 2/ GTA or Saints Row, like minor customizing. If you want a open world game then get GTA 4 or 5, they are far better than this, and offer much more things to do, and are superior to this game in every way. And that is a real shame, since i love mafia 1 and 2.

Refunded, as the game doesn&#39;t run at stable 60 fps on the following PC even with all settings at lowest@1080p:  i5 4670k 4.6ghz gtx 970 1.5ghz/8ghz 16gb ddr3 2400mhz Samsung 840 pro 256gb SSD win10 64  Don&#39;t bother with the game unless you can handle FPS drops below 60fps, don&#39;t mind 30fps lock, or have an i7 5xxx/6xxx and a gtx1060 or better GPU for stable 60fps@1080p. as for 1440p, not even a gtx1080 can max it out at stable 60fps.  It&#39;s also worth noting that the devs have entered the Soon™ mode when it comes to patching the game.  Updated with a video so you can see for yourself how it behaves in a cpu limited area.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omZv7mkmaYI&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be    On the other hand, if you don&#39;t mind sub 60 fps, the game feels much smoother once you fully shift into GPU limited territory, for example, at max settings. The downside is, if you game at 60 fps all the time, you might feel nausea until your brain adapts to lower framerate.   https://youtu.be/hmGc5rKBpbE

I was really looking forward to this game, because Mafia 2 was one of my favorite games the year it was released. But Mafia 3, oh man.. I&#39;ll go over the positives and the negatives.  + Game looks really good sometimes + Story is somewhat interesting + Some main missions are really cool  - The game doesn&#39;t run that well (I got a GTX 1080, I expect a solid 60 fps at 1440p, and I don&#39;t get it). - It doesn&#39;t feel like a Mafia game, it feels like a GTA clone in the 1960&#39;s - 1970&#39;s. - Repetetive side missions, even the main missions.  - Sometimes the game looks really bad, the skyboxes, draw distance look like ♥♥♥♥ most of the time.   I could recommend this game for 29.99 or 34.99, not for 49.99 though.

Graphics are a let down.  You can set screen size, but it doesn&#39;t account properly for ultra wide monitors, despite supporting the resolution - see this screenshot  http://steamcommunity.com/id/age_uk/screenshots/?appid=360430   The menu interface is broken when the game loads and mostly unusable.Which makes for a poor experience right from the word go.   There are some upsides though. Driving mechanics are enjoyable. Shooting people leads to them falling down and wailing in pain and misery on the floor, writhing around. This adds to the immersion and makes it feel more brutal when you pop over to finish them off.   The characters and the acting is fairly good. I think once it&#39;s patched a bit more it&#39;ll improve vastly. Just a shame the shambles was released like this in the first place.

Pros: + great storyline and great characters + many decisions on how to take control of the city + attention to story details + nice landscapes  Cons: - many bugs: mission related and not (felt in the river and had to swim for 10 minutes to get out of there although the slope was ok for that) - after some time it gets repetitive although the bosses businesses are diverse - AI dumb: make some noise outside of a big building, and a guy from the first floor walks for 1 minute directly to you - AI very dumb: sometimes they will come one by one at you even though they are really far away - Escape police in car way to easy - no multiplayer / ko-op - the car chases are made of adamantium: not a scratch after a full frontal crash  Summary:  For the current price i don&#39;t recommend it, although i loved Mafia 2 a lot and was looking forward to this game. Wait for a Sale for it.

I wanted to like this game, I really did.   Mafia II, while having some issues was a solid game, it lacked enough side activities to truly be considered an Open World game in my option, but the story left you wanting to play more, to see new cars as time ticked by, and try different tactics to siege a base, or objective.  Mafia III is just...dull. It doesn&#39;t know what it wwants to be, having gone with an open world feel ,but having lifeless side activities. Go to X, steal this truck. Go to X, steal this boat, go to X, steal the pick up. This would be somewaht forgivable, if the main uests were more exciting, but they are unfortuantly not.  Main quests are a hamster wheel of repeated tasks. Kill 2 smaller bosses after completing enough side quests to reveal the main boss of the area, kill the main boss in a linear attack vector so that we can set up a show piece.  In the current format I cannot honestly reccomend this game, you are better off picking up GTA, or Saints Row as both have more character, and are better Open worlds depending on your choice of super campyness, or somewaht more realistic story lines.

I will reconsider changing this review if the supposed weekend patch sorts these issues out.  Even if I may not have the most high-end system, I should be somewhere in the middle of the minmum and recommend requirements for this game, but the game looks awful at the lowest settings and runs horrible for something to looks so bad. The game is also locked to 30 FPS and the settings are subpar for a PC-game. The fact that you cant even use a mouse is the menu says alot about the console port that this is.  And even if I may not have been completely sober when buying it, I made the mistake of getting somewhat hyped for this title and preordered it as a result, even going off work a bit early in the hopes of playing it. The lack of review copies and other independet previews should show that the developers or atleast the publisher knew full well what they were doing and it seems really strange to announce that a patch that will fix FPS and settings issues will be released a few days after the actual release, although we will see how this actually works out.  Hopefully upcoming updates fix these inherrent issues, but if not I will refund it and would not recommend to anyone unless they fix it.  Update after the weekend patch: While it runs better it&#39;s far from optimal and still feels like a rather half-♥♥♥♥♥ port in many aspects, and after playing it for a bit I reached the conclusion that this was really not for me.  So I ended up refunding it after all, may buy it at a cheaper price in the future depending on the situation. The first part of the review will remain as it is important to remember how much they messed up the initial launch.

I had previously put a positive review for this game, however after playing the game further it has become quite clear that the missions are completely boring and unoriginal. Most of them follow the formula of &#39;go to marker - kill guy / destroy stuff - repeat - ok now go back to the original marker and kill guy&#39;.  I&#39;ve also changed my mind because the patch that was supposed to address the 30fps lock is useless. This game is an unoptimised mess and even with the patch I barely push past 30fps. In fact, in the Bayou I struggle to get 20fps! This is despite the fact that the graphics are nowhere near what should be considered demanding on a system.  To top it all off, this game is a buggy mess. The game constantly crashes. The latest crash happened during a cutscene at the end of a story mission. I rebooted the game and the checkpoint takes me to the end of the mission, as if the cutscene had just ended, however the objective still says I need to complete the mission. If I die, it says mission failed. I can&#39;t continue the game and I can&#39;t reload a past save because hey, who needs saves when you auto checkpoints right guys?  I have now lost my temper with this game and uninstalled it.

I don&#39;t usually write reviews, but this time I genuinely want to express my thoughts:  THIS GAME IS BAD!   As you probably know, there is a 30FPS lock (which according to Mafia III official page, will be fixed soon), gameplay feels wonky (shooting is okay), the AI probably has inner monologue which would explain some funny reaction delays and decisions, and the game looks and feels outdated... Like  last-gen  outdated.  If you really want this game, check the reviews to see if anything was fixed. In this state, I wouldn&#39;t recommend it to anybody.   EDIT:  Forgot to mention the odd traffic. As I was driving around, I noticed some cars abruptly changing their paths, or driving in a zig-zag style. This happened with a cop car as well, which was going in the right direction, and all of a sudden it made a sharp &#39;jump&#39; (it looked like the car re-spawned) and appeared 15 meters right in front of me. Needless to say, we crashed...  There also appear to be issues with lighting, where objects are improperly lit.  The only thing I liked in this game are those cutscenes that look like interviews. They are detailed and the facial animations are gorgeous.  This was my first and quite possibly the last pre-order, I&#39;m glad Steam has a refund system in place. Thank you Valve!

I&#39;m not even going to comment on the obvious optimization problems with the game, my focus is the story. It appears the good people at 2K decided to go political, but not in any kind smart meaningful way. Basically, think of every negative 60s southern white stereotype then magnify it by 100. In the Mafia III world, all whites use N every other word and if you weren&#39;t a crooked cop involved in a conspiracy to keep the Black man down, you were an overalls wearing, black woman ♥♥♥♥♥♥, moonshine swilling hillbilly. I found myself actually laughing during the Dixie gang missions because it reminded me so much of Redneck Rampage(not a good thing). And again having black people on street corners with their very in depth two line conversations about LBJ and Nixon is equally as laughable. 2K&#39;s attempt to tie Mafia III to any kind of serious vietnam/civil rights commentary is akin to a &#39;Jack the Ripper&#39; game trying to make the Women&#39;s Suffrage movement a large part of the storyline. Let&#39;s not forget who we are here Mafia series, let&#39;s cut to the chase. This game glorifies and celebrates the Mafia. An organization which has infected arguably the highest levels of American government, corrupting and killing untold numbers over many decades. Like GTA, Saint&#39;s Row, and others, gamers check their brains and morality at the door while pretending to be thieving mass murderers. To even attempt such political commentary in a game like this brings 2K&#39;s taste and judgement into question. When it comes to history, stick to what you know, clothes, cars, guns, and nudie magazines. The shallow end of the pool is where you should be swimming 2K, don&#39;t stray from it.

So, I don’t think this game is for everyone. I enjoyed it a lot, mainly because I really liked the car handling. I actually feel this might have the most enjoyable car handling in all of the open world games out right now, it reminded me of the old Driver games.  That was the best part of the game for me, driving around and exploring the city. Again I think this may have the best and most immersive city I’ve seen in terms of the actual layout and building architecture. It’s also a unique city for once and not just another recreation of New York that we’re all tired of. New Orleans (New Bordeaux in the game) has a nice variety of different districts and swamps that make it really fun exploring and taking in the sights.  The other thing I loved is that there are loads of enterable locations, restaurants, warehouses, houses, derelict houses, some public buildings, a church. GTA V could learn a lot from this, that had like f*cking 6 buildings to enter, where here it’s a lot more, I didn’t count but it’s like 50 to 100 enterable locations.  But that’s kinda where the praise ends. This has one of the most repetitive mission structures I’ve played through. All the missions play out exactly the same, go here, take out everyone stealthily (if you can) and then kill the gang boss. There is no variety to it at all except for the fact that it’s all in different locations. I tell a lie, there’s a few main story missions that deviate from that formula, but they are few and far between.  Since they patched it, the performance has improved a bit, they also fixed the weather so it behaves normally now and doesn’t feel like sunrise and sundown is sped up at 5 times the normal speed. It still doesn’t run that well though, so….  The game was rushed out though, some of the side missions are glitched, or show you can do them when you can’t, so you drive down to collect a truck to deliver, following the marker, and upon arrival f*ck all is there. I completed all the missions in the game but it still shows that 2 aren’t finished for me cos the games bugged.  There are also small things that are unfinished, for instance a story mission building has these water fish tanks and these side wall pillar tanks that you can shoot out and shatter….but there’s no fish or water in them! And that building wasn’t under construction or anything, so there should’ve been some Nemo’s and Dory’s swimming around. Also there are shops, bars and supermarkets you can enter but can’t buy anything from.  Some people were praising the story, which I don’t really understand. It’s a generic revenge tale, where you just go around and systematically kill everyone. The writing and actors performances are top notch, but the actual plot is generic action fodder.  I guess where it deserves credit is the depiction of 60’s era racism. I’m not American, I didn’t live through the 60’s and I’m not black so I couldn’t tell you how spot on it is, but playing as Lincoln Clay you get to witness the discrimination and overt racism that only minorities usually get to experience. If you enter certain shops or bars people attack you, cos they have signs on the outside saying whites only and no coloreds allowed and sh*t. Also, every single cop you see in the game stares at you when you just walk around the city without doing anything, profiling you.  You can speed past the cops in a car though, going 120 miles an hour on the wrong side of the road and they won’t chase you, which goes back to this game being only half finished. Even when they do chase you it’s fairly easy to lose them.  Overall I would only really recommend this if you enjoy exploring open world games. I got it cheap, 50% off so I don’t regret buying it, but if you want a challenge gameplay wise then look elsewhere, I put it on the hardest setting and I breezed through it, there was no real challenge to any of the repetitious missions, and bear in mind that’s the WHOLE game, so you’ve been warned my fine feathered friend.

 http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=776257037   Nutshell: So an arms dealer is upset that she was shutdown because police think black people will buy guns and shoot white people. The main character then proceeds to buy a gun from her and shoot white people. This is one very confused game.   Cons:  - Buggy in general  - Floating objects  - Lighting issues  - Clipping with objects  - NPCs that can be pulled through walls  - Story is a contradiction of itself and poorly presented.  - Plays exactly the same as every other open world game you have already played.     Pros:  + Soundtrack  + Runs smoothly for the most part (ignoring the FPS drama)     The game has been poorly written and it&#39;s hard to feel sympathy or understanding when the developer keeps undoing the points they think they are trying to make. In one scene they will try to show how poorly black people were spoken to with name calling. But then right after that, the black characters themselves will call other black characters &#39;N****R&#39; and &#39;Coon-asses&#39;  Another example is when a scene is set up to make the player feel sympathy for a poor woman &#39;Abused and used&#39; by a horrible man that the character is required to kill, and then once again undoes the whole scene by later revealing that she was faking it all. Why? For what purpose?  The dev fails at trying to make a statement with the narrative by trying to play both sides. Don&#39;t try and garner sympathy and understanding for a character&#39;s plight when they themselves are a thief and mass murderer. Pick one and stick to it.   At the moment I couldn&#39;t recommend this game to anyone for either the gameplay or the story.   -------------------------- i7-4790K @ 4.00Ghz MSI GeForce GTX 980Ti Gaming 6GB 16GB ram ASRock Z97 Extreme6 Samsung 850 EVO Series 1TB SSD

This is only a Mafia game by name, almost no other connection to Mafia 2. What a ripoff  In Mafia 2 you can go into car shops to customize everything from wheels to paint to the license plate. Go into clothing stores and buy different suits, and go to diners to eat and restore health. You have several different homes all with a garage where you can STORE YOUR CARS AND KEEP THEM FOR LATER. The characters are fleshed out and actually make you care about them. None of this is in Mafia 3  In Mafia 3 you play as a jarhead Vietnam vet that lives in the basement of a burnt-out bar for the entire game like a troll, wears the same jacket every day. You have a set of 6 cars (not counting the ones on the street) you can chose from that you can upgrade, you can&#39;t change paint/license plate/wheels though. The characters are laughable and you never develope any sort of connection to them the way you do in Mafia 2. And worst of all is the gameplay, it ♥♥♥♥ing sucks. The entire game consists of: Receive mission from dude, Kill/Interrogate this dude, do it again, do it again, go back to original dude, kill boss, rinse, repeat. ♥♥♥♥ this game, the only attachment to Mafia 2 is the fact that Vito is added as one of the side characters, and Leo Galante is referenced several times and makes an extremely brief appearence near the end of the game.   4.5/10, don&#39;t waste your ♥♥♥♥ing money on this.

  This game isn&#39;t awful   , but you&#39;ll get easly bored by this game after 5-6 hours. The missions are so similar, that it&#39;s feels like you are repeating them over and over. And the only reason you may bother to do that is to experience the storyline which has quality. I like the fact they aren&#39;t p♫ssyfoting around subjects like racism. And I also like the soundtrack.   I have never understood why someone would watch others play games on youtube (and similar channels), but after experiencing this game i do understand. I would rather watch someone else play this game than play it myself, maybe even by someone as goofy as &#39;pewdiepie&#39;.

This game is mediocre at best and lacks feature that made the 2nd in the franchise pretty fun to play. I think if they would of added a Shadow of Mordor general type of system with mob bosses and luitenants it would of been much better. To sum it up, Mafia III is like playing an outdated Mafia sequel with better eye candy.   Cons:  ~Very repetitive, for example: Missions, animations, and music that makes the game feel more like a grind than enjoyable.  ~Weird lighting that makes lakes/rivers glow like the sun when the sky is dark and cloudy.  ~Arcade feel all around. ~Classic mafia gameplay that has less features than Mafia II.   Pros:  ~Decent graphics.  ~Voice acting and facial animations are very good. ~Colectable bewbies. ~The stealth system. ~The story so far is predictable but, still enjoyable.

So, as with just about every game thats released these days Mafia 3 needs more. More of what you may ask. More of everything. It&#39;s not a bad game. Very much in the vein of GTA, but with less to do. 45hrs in and I&#39;m quickly running out of things to entertain me.   The missions vary in location, however the mechanics of each engagement are almost identical, especially once you get a silenced pistol: Pick off senries or patrols, move in to the interior ring of patrols in stealth, pick off (either headshot or whistle/stab) further guards until you confront the boss. Usually a grenade in the final room is a quick and efficient way of clearing the boss and anyone else unlucky enough to be in the room with them.  &#39;Interrogating&#39; informants? Nah, just shoot them in the head. No need to &#39;chase&#39; them down. Just shoot them and they&#39;ll kneel in place waiting to spill the beans.  Mafia 3 rewards stealth gameplay more than any other. This is a little odd as the Mafia are not remembered because of their invisibility.   If you&#39;re looking for an open world crime game then GTA V would be a better choice if I&#39;m honest. I&#39;ve enjoyed Mafia 3 and don&#39;t regret buying it, the world thats been created is both beautiful and brutal. However boredom is now setting in. Theres only so long I can do the same things over and over and over.  There will obviously be DLC for this game (getting so tired of this model. The passion for creating a profit over a product), perhaps I&#39;ll revist then, or perhaps not.

UPDATE at 9th of October 2016  It is just fair to give you informations about the last patch:  To make it short: nothing has changed concerning freezes, crashes and bluescreens. Every 30 minutes the game decides to kill my PC and I have to make a hard reset.  Also the keyboard mapping has not become better. Double bindings are still not possible and extra mouse keys (thumb keys) are still not supported.  At the moment: Stay away from this game until they have fixed it.  Considering the bad textures, developers might be interesting in updating those too.  Framelock has been lifted. Possibility for unlimited frames. Does not really change a lot.  ***  Freeze, crashes, restart, crash, stutter, lag and pixelated textures. Even after reinstalling newest nvidia driver, crashes and now the game even starts in German, but crashes immediately. 30 fps lock did actually not bother me for the 20 minutes I played it.  I am sure the story is interesting, I am sure the dialogues are great and the experience in Nouvelles Orléans is going to be new and cool. But before I actually can experience this, I am pressed to unfortunately give this game a negative rating.   Besides of the mentionned crashes, the 20 minutes I played, I did not like that the controller settings do not allow to bind extra mouse keys, that double bindings of keyboard keys is not properly solved. That the camera is jumping back to default even if you turn it with the mouse in another direction. These are all typical console port problems you will get from a bad port. It is actually a shame that 2K has been recently developping mostly very messed up games. I remember that they have been top in PC development. But sorry, this port, this release, this so called expensive AAA game is a mess.   Now we know again why no PC reviews have been available before release. I do not want to refund the game, because I am sure that I like the game - if I am able to play it -, but the developers have to work fast and hard now to patch all those problems out, in order to give the PC community just a normal port of a decent game. Did we ask too much?  Until then, I can&#39;t recommend the game. This is hopefully going to change in a few days and I am willing then to review of course my position then.   Besides of this. No native 3D vision support is also a big let down. But I understand, asking for this at the actual state of Mafia 3 on release day is simply too much.  You want to compare Mafia III to GTA V. Forget it! I just say worlds in between.  Developers, get to work on PC patches and fixes !!!

First, the game won&#39;t even start if you have an older AMD CPU with no SSE4.1 support that is otherwise perfectly capable of handling a game of this level of complexity.  Even No Man&#39;s Buy devs had had this issue sorted within a day after launch IIRC.   Then there&#39;s the 30 FPS cap that has no reason to be there because the picture is apparently upscaled from 900p so  any  half-decent GPU should have no trouble rendering this blurry mess at 45-60 FPS.  And of course there&#39;re crashes and freezes and all kinds of hiccups that will happen at least once per hour on average.  However good the story and gameplay may be, this is a completely botched port hastily copy-pasted from consoles. Please show some self-respect as a PC gamer and don&#39;t buy this game until it&#39;s properly fixed  and  50% off. This level of incompetence on the devs&#39; part  should  be bad for their business.  Refunded.

I went to a games expo on the last weekend and the video demo was great. But it was a video.  I have a gtx 970 with 16 GB of ram. all but the GPU is new from this year.  Game is locked at 30 FPS and at high/max setting, it doesnt look good as the videos.... besides the cutscenes, which look like 1080p. Also the game crashed 2 times. going from the cutscenes to gameplay.  For the 1 hour and 50 mins I&#39;ve been playing. the story looks good.  I hope they fix this or I&#39;m getting my money back.

Stay away and spare your wallet.  I mean, It was boring. And it lacked the signature mafia feeling that we learned to love in mafia 1 and 2. it feels as the game almost tries to be more like gta in order to appeal to a wider audience, but it fails misserably. It has alot of bugs and is as optimized as a potatoe. The driving is sluggish and dosent feel right. The game is very repetetive as you need to do basically the same thing 8 times per district and there are 6 districts. The game isnt even hard as i played it on hard and thought it was easy. There are no options like customizing cars or clothing and it lacked in small details which led to the world just feeling a little bland and dead. The AI is as stupid as a rock. It has some annoying elements to it. Like you loose half of your money you have on you when you die so you need to store it. There arent that much you can spend it on other than weapons and upgrades like vehicle upgrades which is just a wasted opportunity opposed to having an actual vehicle customization system. You can also buy upgrades for Lincoln which is also wasted opportunity as a level / progression system could have been in place instead. The story missions are good If somewhat mediocre And The cutscenes look amazing. The gun play is on point and The soundtrack is Great. Overall.. Its just a repetetive mediocre experience

This game was made for console players with their restricted outdated hardware and thrown to PC as a cheap port. The graphic options are a joke and the graphic itself doesn&#39;t even nearly look like 2015 or 16&#39;s PC standard. It&#39;s a blurry upscaled mess.  They knew exactly why they didn&#39;t allow any testing reviews before the release.  An unfinished game but demanding the full price.  For all those whining fanboys:  Yes, we are on Steam platform and not XBOX Marketplace or Playstation Store. So i await a game on PC standards.  I took a refund and as long as all this mess isn&#39;t going to be patched i&#39;ll keep my negative review.  Ich habe fertig!  Specs: i7-6700k 16 GB RAM 2x 980ti SLI

the frame rate is unlocked now and they fixed the weird resolution/blur issue, but the game doesn&#39;t run at 60fps. i&#39;d recommend the game for the story, soundtrack, gameplay, graphics, but none of that matters until the game runs well.  edit: i just started getting crashes as well. change graphics settings, crash. cutscene ends, crash.  i really want to play this game, i enjoy it quite a bit but it seems like the game is doing everything it can to stop me from playing it.

Story: 4/10 Starts really strong but then quickly turns generic and boring throughout the whole game. Even Vito offers nothing interesting.  Gameplay: 3/10 The missions are unfortunately VERY repetitive. There is no difference between the main missions and the optionals except for a very small number of unique and cinematic missions (like the steamboat or shooting up the KKK). The guns are fun, but the horrible stupid AI (who is just so willing to be killed by you) make both stealth and combat super easy. I only died a couple of times because of the stupid, not-computer-friendly controls and the cover system. You can just whistle to lure someone into your direction (they will go 1 at a time), kill him, repeat over and over again. The 7th guy won&#39;t be thinking &#39;hmmm what happened to my 6 buddies?&#39;... Driving behaviour and physics are awful, but tbh I still had fun driving around. Altho there isn&#39;t much driving included in the missions (except for the optionial boring stuff), so wasted potential here. And for some absurd reason they got rid of features that were in the previous games, like buying/changing clothes (or stores in general), car physics (demolition, destruction), cops that don&#39;t shoot you on the smallest delict (plus I want to note that the whole state knows about you the very second one bloody cop spots you - no matter how quickly you take him out), and many more.  Graphics: 4/10 People complain alot about the overall graphics but for me it&#39;s more on the technical side: Graphics glitch out or don&#39;t load properly at times, especially when you drive fast. The lighting, which can be very awful and points and then be really great in other moments. And second, the skyboxes... they are just... really effin weird. There is also some really weird weather transitions at random points (not talking about quick transitions that are mission-related). The overall graphics like geometry and textures are totally fine to me and had some beautiful moments. Especially the cinematics and animations are really well done. It seems like performance-wise the game is alot more demanding than it should be for this quality.  Sound: 8/10 Weapons and vehicles sound good, soundtrack is great (obviously, c&#39;mon you know the songs!) Tho, it&#39;s really annoying that your wheels are screaming the very second you hit the forward button.  Final words: This game does not deserve the title &#39;Mafia III&#39; The game can be fun and I played through it because of the great soundtrack and atmosphere. But there is also alot of frustrating and boring moments. If you want to give this game a try, do it when it&#39;s on sale. Not worth the full price.

Played 2 hrs of Mafia3, it doesn&#39;t seems to get any better because after the patch 1.01 my fps barely even 30 fps and my game was freezing when i was aiming or driving and crash at almost every single save point.   Story is good and all but the AI in game are just bunch of idiots walking around even i set it on hardest difficulty.  The view point + view distance was just more screwed up then i thought.  The Graphic all were so pixelated and without high textures at all, and i wonder why you even need high resolution setting when everything were almost the same as low resolution.  Conclusion: This game is a waste of time and money, i rather play a solid game with freezing and crashing, with great graphic and fps. Don&#39;t even buy this if you don&#39;t want to go though all this stupid issue they have before even publishing it.So i refunded it.

First off, the lip sync in some of the cutscenes are so bad. Lag when you reach a high speed whilst driving or even when your normally driving. Missions sometimes glitch out, e.g. You go into a building but the character you are with doesn&#39;t follow you in there glitching out the mission which makes you have to either restart the game or the mission.  Don&#39;t buy it for it&#39;s current price.

This is a bad console port of a rushed game.  - Repetitive gameplay. - Full of annoying bugs. - Frequently crashes to desktop. - Runs like ♥♥♥♥ on the lowest settings. Even though I can run GTA V on ultra.  I can not recommend a game in this state. Maybe I would after several months of patches...

I&#39;m a huge fan of Mafia II. Loved the story, gameplay and had tones of fun. Didnt bother me that open world aspect of the game wasn&#39;t as evolved and interesting as you can get in GTA.   This one is just far from OK. I have been waiting for this game since I saw trailer on youtube and what I received is a childlish version of some idea that could have been great. AI is just unbearable! What a shame and downfall of this great title.  Would&#39;t recommend and I feel I wasted my money!!!

This game is unbelievably hit and miss...  The story and presentation are stunningly well done, it&#39;s a little generic but the delivery is impeccable. The shooting feels great and the setting has the potential to be gourgeous, that&#39;s the key word here, potential.  Pretty much everything feels almost solid, almost great, but not quite there yet. The city is beautiful but dead and plagued with graphical errors, glitchy citizens, awkward animations, a 20ft draw distance, the jankest weather cycle I think i&#39;ve ever seen and so much more. The swamp is once again, beautiful but ruined by a terrible draw distance and odd glitches. The gun play is great, the AI is stupid. The melee combat is impactful, the animations are awkward and clunky. The visual design is stellar, it&#39;s ruined by a low framerate. Nothing is perfect and the only area where it truly excels is in the presentation of its story (The small amount of it that i have seen atleast).  Now aside from the big FPS problem and all the issues listed above the game is playable, very jumpy and annoying, but playable. The issues which make the game nearly unplayble for me are the filter, blur effects and glitches. The game has a p*ss filter which cannot be turned off, the filter is to make the game more &#39;thematic&#39; as though you&#39;re viewing it through an old camera. This does make it feel somewhat more thematic due to the documentary style of delivery but honestly it isn&#39;t worth it, I&#39;d rather just enjoy the period as it was. The blur is beyond frustrating if anything is more than 10 meters away it becomes incredibly blurry, text is unreadable, NPC faces become gelatinous blobs and gun fights are like a god damn earthquake. It feels as though the developers are trying their hardest to hide their lower res textures with obnoxious visual effects masquarading as &#39;style&#39;, it&#39;s just bad.  The glitches are a whole thing on their own, cars pop through the ground and glide through you until you die, NPC&#39;s fall over for no reason and fling through walls when ever so much as touched in a car, the police walk on water (not kidding), take downs don&#39;t connect and sometimes enemies will just stand still and shoot at nothing. It&#39;s ridiculous and the game even crashed to desktop twice during just two hours of play.  Potential is coursing through Mafia III&#39;s veins, but raging type 2 diabetes and concrete surfing soft tops make sure you never bloody see it.  I&#39;m not giving a rating with just two hours of play, don&#39;t buy it until it&#39;s confirmed that these problems are fixed.

Pre ordered from GMG so I can&#39;t get a refund (completly my fault) but if I could I would. I cannot play games at 30fps (unacceptable in 2016) so I waited patiently for the patch before playing unfortunately, the game is a mess even with the patch. I can&#39;t get 60fps, no SLI suport so one of my 980&#39;s is just sitting there chilling while the other is having a stroke struggling to run a s****y consol port with 512x512 textures at a steady 50fps (game fluctuates between 36 to 43fps).

The game storyline is brilliant but there&#39;s other factors that made me don&#39;t recommend this game...  Pros: -Great storyline -Loved the combat system -Liked UI -Graphics are brilliant -Cutscenes are realistic  Cons: -Don&#39;t like the main character (No offense, I just don&#39;t think he should be the main character) -It doesn&#39;t look like it&#39;s optimised (Several freezes occurred during playing) -Volumetric lighting, reflection quality is too demanding... -Changing screen resolution can sometimes makes the game in boardless window. -Feels like GTA...  Overall, the game can be improved in terms of performance, some settings are demanding however but it shouldn&#39;t be a major issue if you and I don&#39;t have such a great PC. However, the game feels like it&#39;s GTA which actually put me off. I liked Mafia II, I prefer that over this game any day.  Score: 5.5/10

Sooo, Mafia III  What a game who was teased along past years...  New style, Black mafia in the New Orleans during segregation instead of Italian mafia in NY during the 40&#39;s.  On the paper, I love it, I like the city of New Orleans, I like the culture of the city, the music the mood, so for me already a great point.  First of all, I have to write that I played the game day 1, so, with the Framecap at 30FPS (But working, no bugs) and i Write this 4 days after the Patch to Uncap the Framerate. By the way, all the crying kid who insta-spit on the review section of Mafia &#39;Because 30FPS in 2016 is laim&#39;, just remember your computer dont even support 60FPS on Ultra, so go ♥♥♥♥ yourself.  GAMEPLAY :  Simple, really really simple but it worked perfectly.  GTA Like, open world in a copy of the New Orleans, you can obviously go wherever you want when you want, the animations of moving and in Combat are really good, weapons sounds are on top, Driving if configurable, not bad, not good.  SCENARIO :  THis is the big argument of the game. The scenario is awesome. You want to go deep in the story to understand what happen to you. NO SPOIL HERE but this is the big point of the game.  SOUNDS :  The OST is perfect...If you like 60/s Music, Creedence Clearwater Revival, The Rolling Stones, Temptations etc... Really good OST  Now, those were my 3 good points  What I didn&#39;t like in the game :  GRAPHICS :  The style of the game is good, it&#39;s atmospheric, moody and it&#39;s ok BUT there is a big LACK of technique. Clipping, collision bug, the aliasing is inexistent.  IA :  O M G  This is the worst IA I saw on a looong time. Ennemies are puppets, you are the Master (Yeah, like Metallica too)  I never see mafioso stupid as table like this. THIS MAKE THE GAME EASY AS F***  So, really like it because i love movies about this period and I really love this kind of OST but CLEARLY NOT PERFECT.  I Recommend but not by far  (Approximate English, SORRY)

We all know about the low 30FPS, which is being sorted as we speak.  3 or so hours into the game and here&#39;s my pros and cons.  Pros: - Great Storyline (So far) - Music is great, as always. - Cutscenes are fantastic, makes you feel part of the game.  Cons: - Obvioulsy the FPS, lags when driving in high detail areas. - Game can crash at certain times, has happened to me a few times. - AI are stupid, had to restart a mission due to one being stuck and unable to follow me. - Poor lighting when weather changes. I&#39;ve had it that numerous times that when I&#39;m driving on a sunny day, when all of a sudden it&#39;s dark and cloudy.  Will &#39;re-review &#39; once the new patch has been released, but for now we&#39;ll have to either now play, or put up with the FPS and bugs,

Well first off I&#39;ll say that I knew what I was getting into, just bought this due to huge boredom.  Story is ok so far, but the thing that probably annoys everyone playing Mafia 3 is that the missions are pretty much the same thing over and over again. You go in to a place and shoot everyone, then you interrogate the gang boss and either kill him or make him join your crew. Graphics are ok for the most part, but there are some really hideous textures like the whole damn sky, which looks like it&#39;s from ps2 game. Performance is ok after patches (100 ish with drops to 60s at max settings with 1070, i5 6600k @4.5ghz). If you for some reason want to play this game make sure to turn off vsync and put framerate to unlimited, locking the framerate will cause ridiculous stuttering and drops to 0 fps for no real reason. Wouldn&#39;t recommend getting it unless you just want to shoot people repetively, since I found the combat quite enjoyable.

***FINAL REVIEW*** (This is my final review after completing the game&#39;s storyline. This review contains SPOILERS)   Mafia 3 had a lot of potential but unfortunetly failed to live up to expectations. The game&#39;s story is a typical revenge story that has the predictable &#39;I&#39;ve become the monster I set out to destroy!&#39; ending. The voice acting and motion capture for cutscenes are generally top notch, though occasionally there&#39;s a cutscene where the visuals look terrible and the acting feels awkward, especially with the priest and his future interviews. His fake crying is unbearable to sit through. I did enjoy getting some closure on the events of Mafia 2 concerning Vito Scarletta and Joe Barbaro, but they felt more like fan service rather than well thought out extensions of their story. I liked the mysterious way Mafia 2 ended, and the fact that they are suggesting that Joe survived kind of ruins the impactful ending of Mafia 2. So yeah, the story is decent and definitely the best reason to play Mafia 3, but it&#39;s nothing extraordinary.   The gameplay is where we start running into some serious problems. After a long 2-hour introduction where the timeline jumps around to help explain how the Mardi Gras heist went down, the game suddenly drops off into a highly repetitive crawl throughout the &#39;open-world&#39; city. I put open world in quotations because the world is beyond empty. There&#39;s quite literally NOTHING to do in New Bordeoux aside from the side missions and main story missions. This would be fine if the side missions weren&#39;t required in order to unlock story missions. Each district in the city requires you to complete 8 repetitive side missions that pretty much always involve you invading an enemy controlled territory and killing a VIP inside. You can approach these missions with stealth or combat, but neither method makes a difference. There&#39;s no reward for playing the game stealthily so there doesn&#39;t seem to be a reason to bother most of the time aside from the thrill of sneaking around undetected. You can kill enemies lethally OR nonlethally, but for some reason, you must change a gameplay setting in the game&#39;s pause menu whenever you want to switch between these methods.   Once you complete a bunch of these side missions, you are forced to return to that district&#39;s friendly AI (where you are a treated to a lazy in-engine cutscene that looks like something out of an old Tony Hawk game) and they tell you to go to one of the side mission locations you JUST cleared to kill an underboss. After killing the underboss, you&#39;re only halfway done... now yuo need to meet another ally in the same district, complete 5-6 more side missions, and then kill another underboss to unlock an actual story mission. Now the story missions are a lot of fun most of the time. They are generally large set-pieces like a burning boxing ring or a crashed river boat where you fight your way to one of Sal Marcano&#39;s lieutenants. There&#39;s about 14 of these large missions and those alone would have made for a fun experience.. but unfortunetly you&#39;re stuck grinding away at this lackluster open world and completing side missions for 20 hours.   Thankfully the side missions can still be fun with the well done ingame economy. I never felt as though I had too much money to spend nor did I feel like mone was too hard to come back. I slowly managed to earn enough money to make upgrades to my arsenal, health, and vehicles. The melee kills are all awesome and never get old and combat often feels really realistic. The vehicle combat is pretty awkawrd, with strange lock-on targetting rather than freeaim and the cars seem to all handle pretty poorly, with vehicles often crashing into curbs and flipping over themselves.   Now that we&#39;re talking about bugs... let&#39;s talk about this game&#39;s technical aspects. They&#39;re terrible.. they&#39;re all terrible! This game crashed at least 10 times on my system, with an average framerate of about 55fps on the maximum graphic settings, and graphics that either look good, or look like GTA San Andreas. Often times when driving on long bridges, the game looks impossibly ugly. Other times, especially during the evening in the Bayou, the game looks beautiful. The game also causes my gtx 980ti&#39;s fans to get really loud, suggesting that the game is forcing my GPU to run way too hot.It&#39;s as if they stopped half-way through when making this game. I encountered several bugs that forced me to restart from checkpoint simply because friendly AI failed to perform scripts that allowed me to continue missions. I also had plenty of vehicles spawning ontop of eachother, AI acting strangely, visual glitches like clouds moving too quickly, and really strange massive saturation when inside buildings.   So if you&#39;re on the fence with your purcahse of Mafia 3.. let me help you. Don&#39;t buy it. Wait till it&#39;s $15 at most. This game is a disaster of a port and even without the technical issues, it feels unfinished with a lackluster game design and repetitive gameplay. It&#39;s a real shame beacuse I was really looking forward to this game, but I don&#39;t see myself replaying this one like I did with Mafia 2.   ________________________________________________________________________________ PC Performance Benchmark:   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBSTG9fH04U&amp;amp;list=PLTxgzJqWtkFZysGjlxeyWbwyJaJbMfWBJ&amp;amp;index=1   Mafia 3 First Impressions Video:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW3VdOZwGZE&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be

Even with the patch and all graphics settings maxed out, this game still looks like something from 2009.  Also the K/B controls need some improving. There&#39;s no way to remap &#39;melee&#39; to one of the extra buttons on my mouse and even the &#39;counter&#39; button needs to be remapped better. The devs at Hangar 13 probably don&#39;t know that there are gaming mice out there that have more than just a left button, a right button, and a middle mouse button.  Okay... it&#39;s a day later and I found that I needed to increase the FOV for my 24&#39; monitor from the default 60 to 78 and it improved the graphics. It&#39;s still not as pretty as GTA 5, but still better than when I first started playing. Also, I read somewhere someone&#39;s suggestion to lower the AA in the game and that seems to help as well. But, I did increase the AA in my NVIDIA control panel.

SHORT REVIEW: Average Game not worth $80. Buy it only for $30-$40  LONG REVIEW:  So, after beating the game completely (with all side missions and stuff) I can say that this game is worth buying only on discount or rent. Throught out the whole game the best part to keep you coming back is only the story (WHICH IS DRAGGED AS HELL) and right after you beat it you just dont feel like playing it anymore at all. I just realise how much I had to force myself to play it until the end. The game might and probably will fascinate you at first like it did to me, but later on it just gets SO ♥♥♥♥ING REPETETIVE to the point that you just sit in your chair bored as hell and trying to reach the end. The gameplay is very repetetive but the part that repeats itself (driving and combat) are made on a pretty good level which makes it possible to play this game. The story on the other hand in my opinion was pretty good but WAY WORSE than Mafia 2 story. From the beginning to the end you already know what is going to happen and its just simply disappointing. The ending isnt that great either they only made it a bit better by showing a little surprise and a throwback to the older games. In my opinion Vitos storyline in this game is better than the main one. So lets see the pros and cons of this game.  GAME SCORING: Combat 10/10 Driving 8/10 Open World (Alive but nothing to do) 5/10 Story 6.5/10 Vito&#39;s Story (Very Short Since It&#39;s A Side Story) 9/10 Level of Repetitevness (Try hitting a wall a thousand times and make yourself think that you are doing something new every time) 10/10 Cinematics 10/10 Graphics 7/10 Atmosphere 8/10 (Good atmosphere but just isnt that Mafia one that I wanted when getting this game) Soundtrack 9/10 (Just too short and gets repetetive often) Boss Levels 8/10 (Again good levels but are just too predictive and simple (even on the highest difficulty))  OVERALL SCORE: 6.5/10 This game is an average game that is not good nor is bad. Didn&#39;t find it that great to be honest and I alreadt know that I wont buy any DLC&#39;s or play this game again unless something really attracts my attention. Buy this game only if it&#39;s on discount, rent, pirate it, or just watch the cutscenes on YouTube (that&#39;s pretty much the good thing about the game).  Was very excited for the game and expected to get a masterpiece like the first titles but got an avarage game not worth $80 in my opinion. Same as with Battlefront from DICE.  EDIT: Not gonna lie after some time passed I do wanna play it again LOL only due to the combat. In my opinion it&#39;s very good and makes me wanna play it. But just like overwatch only for a little bit of time. In the future when they release more updates for the open world and who knows what, if they will turn out to be fun and make this open world an actual open world where you can do more than just shoot and drive, I&#39;ll change my opinion and will say that it&#39;s worth the money. Just like GTA this game will get better in the future but I ain&#39;t sure about that. They have the potential but didn&#39;t realise it yet I think...

To day Lates Patch Finally Got a chance to play..   And found it somewhat laking in enjoyment      ///////////////////////////Original Comment///////////////////////////////////  Currently the game Is broken for a large number of people.  For me as soon game launches near instant crash to desktop.    Maybe I will update review IF/When game is FIXED.  -- Update even with the new patch game is still broke,   While not the biggest waste of my money in resent years. It was a definate mistake.

As a fan of the 2 previous Mafia games, this one so far is a disappointment. 30fps locked (mumbles something about consoles) and random crashes. I expected the physics and the graphics to be better. They are ok, they don&#39;t seem to match the screenshots even after changing graphic settings, maybe I&#39;m missing something but I doubt it.   The only good thing about it at the moment is the storyline. I can only hope they fix the major issues quickly or I will be requesting a refund.  Gone are the days where you can expect to pay top dollar for a game that isn&#39;t full of bugs on release.

If you&#39;re expecting the same level of gameplay depth as mafia 2. Run away. This game is a very dumbed down version of mafia. Signs are all over the place to show you with turn to take (no kidding) where doors are. Even picking a lock has been simplified. It&#39;s really an insult to our intelligence.  AAA games have been becoming more and more dumbed down throughout the years and this is a sad example of that. The game is still good, but it&#39;s really an insult we shouldn&#39;t just accept.  The graphics? The light effects look better, everything else looks weird. Objects close to you will sometimes be blurry (especially your own car), teeth of the characters look strange too. Overal, I&#39;d say mafia 2 looks better (for now).  TL:DR if you never played mafia? Buy this, play this, then play mafia 2. If you&#39;ve already played mafia 2. Stay away until you lower your expectations.

Mafia 3 is still broken, 2 of my missions are broken, the sky in the game is broken..the morning sunrise, looks like hell on earth...... skies in free games are better than the sky in this game. DO NOT BUY until like 2018, maybe then after about 50 patches it&#39;ll work. BTW, It has had 2 paches, each 1.2gb each one.
compound: -0.1531, neg: 0.148, neu: 0.699, pos: 0.153, 
Let me start by saying, that I couldn&#39;t wait to play Mafia 3. The game has a really strong start plotwise, but then the side quests kick in... And after that all you do is:  1. Pick up a mission. 2. Go to a few places, where you kill a bunch of goons and interrogate their leader to get information. Now you are being offered a choice to either spare him and add some money to your racket, or kill him and earn some cash straight away. 3. Go to a another place, that is, again filled with goons - Kill them all. 4. When you have done enough damage to lure out the racket boss, you will have to kill him and his goons.  After you&#39;ve done all of this, the main story continues a bit and you get to see a cutscene. Then repeat, repeat, repeat and repeat.   The controls for the keyboard + mouse takes a little time to get used to. AI is also pretty dumb. For example, when I was interrogating a guy, another goon just stood there pointing a gun at my head, and waited for me to finish the conversation before he would react.. And when I entered a vehicle with hostile goons in it, the guys at the backseat started shooting at the driver, who I&#39;d just thrown out of the car. There&#39;s bugs here and there, but to some of those I just can&#39;t help but to laugh at.  Some positives though. The soundtrack is really kickass. When you fire up the game, you get to hear Jimi Hendrix + the game offers many hit songs from that era. Don&#39;t want to stop driving when I hear songs by Steppenwolf, Roy Orbison, Otis Redding etc.   I will continue to play this game, but I wouldn&#39;t recommend this to players who:  1. Don&#39;t like repetitive, grindy side missions. 2. Don&#39;t want to be forced to complete side missions in order to continue the main story.  That&#39;s my 2 cents folks!

NOT WORTH THE FULL PURCHASE PRICE  i wouldnt suggest buying this unless it was on sale for at least 50% off.    . blurry textures, very low res textures on many things, locked at 30 fps at launch . Shows how out of touch this developer really is with PC community. Game looks like vaseline was smeared on the screen before you played.    lazy design on the NPC&#39;s. cleared a room of &#39;workers&#39; in a heroin den. EVERY DAMN ONE OF THEM WAS THE SAME NPC.. the npcs you look at look like they are rendered at 240p.  Im going to play the game because i cant get a refund from GMG .   story seems ok.. but right now that all i can say good about it

This game is, wait for it! ... -   FPS:  You all know that it&#39;s locked at 30 fps by now, and that they are going to release a patch for it. Sure, I&#39;ll take that. But why did they even release it to begin with, with a 30 fps lock.. It&#39;s so idiotic.  Graphic: I immediately felt kinda &#39;dizzy&#39; once I started driving a vehicle in the very begning of the game, even though I had motion blur off. My eyes kinda hurt, an absolute turn off for what is suppost to be a beautiful game. Then, if you take an actual look around the surrounding, you will notice how bad everything truely is. The vehicles just a few feet in front of you won&#39;t show any details what so ever until you even get remotely close to it. When you turn around, facing your own character.. - You can&#39;t even see ANY details WHAT SO EVER in his face, and I swear, theres even some blur ON HIS FU*#&amp;amp;NG FACE!!   Story: Don&#39;t know, kinda rage quit and refunded game. I bought the game for the story though, but the overall game is just to bad, can&#39;t bother continuing.   ... - Absolute trash! This game is absolute trash!  Thank you, shoutout to my mum &amp;amp; dad.

I have lost 53 hours of progress after a random crash corrupted the one and only autosave. A truly flawless design and implementation. It may sound frustrating, but I was already planning to abandon the game. I have a high tolerance for repetitive gameplay, but the last 10 hours were a real drag. Being a completionist I have collected and completed everything throughout the game. Do not make the same mistake! Do only what&#39;s absolutely necessary, backup your save manually and maybe you will reach the ending with a happy smile.

i am going to keep it short the story(cutscenes),music and voice acting are good. gameplay is repetitive you keep doing the same thing over the 9 districs you have to take over, the world feels very empty no customization for cars,clothing and buildings the ingame money you earn feels like it has no use then buying weapons wich you don&#39;t do most of the time weapons they all feel the same all you do is headshot with any weapon to insta kill   i would skip this game i am sure there are better games for 50-60 bucks

Game is 30fps, yes but one of the smoothest 30fps i&#39;ve experienced in a PC game. The open world is as basic as it gets, but who is here for the open world aspect really? The combat is the games best feature and its pretty satisfying compare to other open world game. The gunplay is already better than your GTAV gunplay. Theres complaints about the enemies A.I, which ive experienced some dumb moments. Enemies all reacting the same and make the same bad decisions, even breaking aggressive approaches in combat while in a gun fight, to go into stealth A.I animation with my character right in front of clear view.   Honestly the game feels like a early access game. I found out that the devs will be adding the option to change characters clothes after the game launch? sign of a rushed game? I&#39;ve so far small glitches. The graphics are hit and miss, but its decent.   The story is top-notch.   As much as i want my 60fps, i can&#39;t deny that this game isnt fully playable. i&#39;ve had similar bad experience with batman arkham knights and even witcher 3 at launch. The experience for these games got better as the patches rolled in, so i expect the same for this.   The game is pretty playable and worth owning, be it now or later. Its just going to take some patch work, as with many games on the pc, to reach full potential.  PS: I think the devs made some pretty bad mistake with this game. I wish i could of lend some ideas for the game. game has lost potential.
compound: -0.5058, neg: 0.167, neu: 0.673, pos: 0.16, 
Honestly, i can&#39;t recommend this game, here&#39;s why:   1) It looks not very good, it&#39;s low on detail, the districts are very short of people, towns don&#39;t look &#39;Alive&#39; and i was honestly expecting it to look about as alive as atleast mafia 2.   2) It looks like it was made in unity and honestly i expected more here too, it is a AAA game that cost millions of dollars to create. I hope maybe a patch can fix this? maybe not, we&#39;ll see.  3) The game is choppy, and i mean very choppy. It has nothing to do with the 30 FPS because honestly i don&#39;t mind. But if i can run GTA V on highest settings, i expect to run this game without lag and &#39;choppiness&#39;. It ruins the experience.  4) It plays weirdly, the controls are unresponsive, making for a worse experience.  5) The current amount of glitches in the game. If you stand on the roof of a car, your legs will literally stand on the seats. He won&#39;t even stand on the roof, but it seems that certain parts of the cars are &#39;not there&#39; and you can go straight through them.  6) (This is a minor non game breaking one) The talking to people cutscenes that aren&#39;t real cutscenes so they can&#39;t be skipped, are so annoying. You stand there talking like it was a cutscene, but you can&#39;t skip them. They bring nothing to the story, and its an unnecessary evil  In it&#39;s current state, i cannot recommend it, i&#39;ve loved mafia since the first time i played mafia 2, and this game honestly is not worth it, not in it&#39;s current state, there is a patch coming, and i hope to update this to a good review when it&#39;s out, but for now heed my warning. Have a nice day ^~^

Not telling audience about the 30fps cap was shady enough.  But now it makes sense the reason that the game was initially capped to 30fps was that the game was horribly optimised. Running a 980 sli + 4930k and the game can&#39;t hit 60 outside or in.   If the framerate had been good I could have forgived the rubbish graphics which make gta V look like a new crysis, or the generic mafia plot e.g. guys mess with you, build up and empire, slowly pick them off, have a couple crises of morality, kill main bad dude, family avenged.  For PC gaming to be a good overall experience for the £1500+ we spend on our rigs we have to shed the developers that cant be bothered making a good PC port because the guys with the spreadsheets think we&#39;ll buy anything Hello games was a recent example and now its Hanger 13.

The graphics are dissapointing. Could&#39;ve added First Person Driving View so that the rear view mirror function doesn&#39;t seem redundant. Like how the driving works when changed the settings to &#39;simulator&#39;.  Played 2 hrs into the story, didn&#39;t get me hooked or excited unlike the first 2 series (I&#39;ll try to finish the story, but as of my first 2hrs, I don&#39;t feel any hype in the story as compared to it&#39;s predecessor). Mafia Games are supposed to have the most punch in their story!   In short, Mafia III gave you alot of content to play with at the cost of a cinematic story experience. Mafia 2&#39;s story and cinematics were so great! Can&#39;t believe they killed it with Mafia III. =(  Mafia 2 had content quality. Mafia 3 gave content quantity.  Waited for months for this, bought the physical collector&#39;s edition. I must say it&#39;s quite dissapointing. Recommend others to wait for content/graphics updates from 2K before buying.

Just beaten the game...  Well, as a Mafia game it is pretty average.  They should fire their mission designer, also the one came up with the &#39;It&#39;s a good idea to make this game looks like some stupid console port so let&#39;s make it 30fps lock&#39; guy.  First, let&#39;s talk about 30fps, they DID say that there will be a patch allowing you to go 60, but why in the world would anyone think it&#39;s a good idea to NOT have 60 on launch, same goes for changing cloth, as it should be a LATER free update... Is this game half finished?  The mission is lengthy, repetitive and unbearable, you want to do a progress a story quest? Sure, do ALL the regional quest( as in, kill somebody, destory something kind of quest with zero plot involved) first, then you get your story quest. I believe this bs is used to make their the game lengthy, but it feels like some ♥♥♥♥ing grindy korean mmo to me. Once I&#39;m done with the main story line, there&#39;s literally nothing left for me to do... 19 hours. Pfft.  The whistle key is &#39;Delete&#39;, I have no idea who designed this, they really didn&#39;t put any effort on this....  Just don&#39;t buy it...

While this is a good game in gameplay and story terms, I cannot give it a positive rating as I won&#39;t support their development process/model.  30 fps. 4k UI scaling is terrible. hardly readable. Gameplay so far is good.. But for a 2016 game and AAA, it should have unlocked FPS and alterable UI scaling or at least a better one than this.

Well, I bought the game because I was excited for the next game in the Mafia lineup, but only untill the day before it was released did I know it was gonna be locked at 30 frames. Then 2K somehow got all the major game magazines and websites to not write a review untill the actual release date, so no one had no way of knowing the game was gonna be locked at 30 frames because they thought no one would pay 60 bucks for it that way. I know I wouldn&#39;t. They already released a patch to fix that, but it still doesn&#39;t run at 60 frames. A few other guys plus myself still can only get the game to run at 40, at most, so theres that. I&#39;m mostly confused as to why 2K would develop a game on a computer, like all videogames, then not opitmize it for PC. Plot goes something like &#39;You&#39;re not actually in the Italian Mafia, but you fight them.&#39; Great way to ruin the trilogy. People ahve been complaining that the main character is black. I don&#39;t have a problem with a minority main character, but like I said, I am dissapointed that the player isn&#39;t actually in the mafia. So. Here&#39;s where we stand. I got a triple-A title, for 60 bucks, that wasn&#39;t even opitimzed for PC, without any way of nowing it, thats so far unplayable, has nothing to do with either of the former games all relased by a developer who cares nothing for the PC community. But hey, at least I got called the N-word within the first 5 minutes of gameplay, y&#39;know, right before the game crashed. Moving on. Cops are worse than in GTA 5. For whatever reason, the cops shoot on sight, regardless on whether or not I&#39;ve comitted a crime. I&#39;ll just be driving down the road, a cop&#39;ll yell something like &#39;hey, stop right there!&#39; and just start shooting. Cops have unlimited ammo, but when they die, they don&#39;t drop any guns or ammo. Speaking of which, cops don&#39;t make arrests. Accidently crashed into a light pole? Too bad. Dead. When you die, you loose exactly half your cash, any ammo you used in the gunfight and you get respawned wherever 2K pleases. Very poorly thought out game. 0/10. 2nd worst game of all time, next to No Man&#39;s Sky.  Update: This game keeps crashing and my PC keeps overheating. I run a GTX 980 TI and a 3.6 GHz processor. This shouldn&#39;t be happening. Serious optimization issues here.  Update: Game just crashed for the 6th time in less than 20 hrs of gameplay.

&#39;Me Too&#39;: This is obviously the motto the Game designers went for when making this game, It has the Shallow &#39;Do this, than to the same thing again, all over the map&#39;-Syndrom from a Ubisoft Sandbox, the unnecessary Hitman X-Ray vision and the Terrible interface from GTA V seemingly just because it tries to fit in with them, and fails.   It blaitantly ignores established Mafia canon (mentioning Chicago, the city that Lost Haven was supposed to be replacing in Mafia 1, it renames cars aswell as guns for no reason) but the biggest offender is the missing features for me, You can&#39;t customise your outfit so you are stuck with the Military brown Rubbish Bag Jacket and you can&#39;t customise cars and with that saving them has fallen out of need as well.  (Note that they have released a patch to adress the outfit Problem but it still is simply too late for anyone to care)  The entire game evokes the fat kid trying to befriend the Cool kids in school and doesn&#39;t succeed with that or with it&#39;s grades, and as it&#39;s english teacher in this metaphor I give the story it tries to tell a D- with none of the characters getting any depth and no character dynamics being conveight, it smacks you about with time jumps and flashbacks that are simply more irritating than a story told straight forward which also smacks of just doing this because the game saw it in Hollywood movies rather than because it helps the story in any way and it ends up a mess.  Towards the begining... excuse me, Twords thah beginin&#39; liddle Boahi Mafjah 3 do has the noshion of naht carin and juhst wanting you get to do the gauhd damn clearin out missions, which carreh no weight what so evehr. You would get the same feeling just colouring a map with crayons and punching yourself in the face every time you want to continue.   Every feature that added a bit of realism and lighted up the commute to a new mission from Mafia 2 like lockpicking your way into a car of choice,having to get fuel for it, being able to make it dirty, wash it and giving it new rims and new paint, drive it to a restaurant and have a sandwich is gone which odd to take out because no one has ever complained about it (and if it&#39;s not broke, carry it over to the sequel) but it adds to my suspicion about the developers (&#39;Hangar 13&#39; instead of 2K Chech this time) trying to be a Ubisoft sandbox which in my opinion is the like being the much more boring and limited Playmobil instead of the free ,careless and infinitely customisable Lego of the GTA series.   And besides AssCreed really has been an ♥♥♥ in recent installments,in case you haven&#39;t noticed.  It doesn&#39;t feel like it&#39;s own thing, taking aspects from other games to use without caring that it is all a mess in the end.  Plus it certainly doesn&#39;t offer a satisfying sandbox experience like other before mentioned Crime-focused Car-driving sandboxes do, with none of the customisation and none of the fun and instead of that trying to convince you that filing Disticts under names all day liken a magical politics fairy is fun.  But if you like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ story, string of unfunny clichés about the 1960s,racism and Dah Saouth and like to hear Born to be wild 5 times, Fortunate Son 3 times as well as that song about thing being painted black four times in the first two hours (no joke, I counted) then the game is for you, moron.

Wish it would play on my PC, start screen loads click start attempts to start game then drops it and goes back to the desktop. Now I discover it doesn&#39;t play on PC&#39;s with AMD CPUs, and there is no patch so it can! Who in their right mind releases a game for PCs that doesn&#39;t play on half the worlds PCs!  Quote from  windowsreport.com  &#39;Also, gamers confirmed that Mafia III doesn’t work on AMD CPUs without SSE 4.1 support. The game crashes at desktop, just like MGS V and No Mans Sky.

I mean, come on. 30 fps?  Update: first crash within less than 20 minutes of play. Let&#39;s see if it gets worse.  Update 2: I&#39;ve had five crashes in my 40 minutes of play, I&#39;ll stop playing the game until a patch comes out. Although I really enjoy the tone and the general direction the game seems to be going, I cannot reconmmend the game at its current state.  Update 3: The dev came out and confirms that they knowingly launched the game with the 30 cap, for reasons I can only infer from their statements were due to consoles&#39; limitations. To me, that is no excuse. They say that they know &#39;how important having options...and frames [are]&#39;, blah blah blah. It&#39;s not like they just announced PC version yesterday. If the dev made a mess, I&#39;ll call it what it is.   P.S. for people whose arguments are: &#39;The game isn&#39;t even out in most countries&#39;, therefore the game is somehow not launched and the problems that I&#39;m presenting are somehow invalidated? No. If it is launched in even just one country, then it is launched. If the game is broken in one country, the game is broken, and it shall be rightfully criticized by the customers of that region.

Pro&#39;s  - Great, solid and well written story - Can be played at max grahics at 1440p with a GTX 980  Con&#39;s  - AI is dumber than a bag of hammers - AI repeats the exact same catch-phrases over and over and over and over........ - 30 FPS lock (holy cr*p WHY?!?!) - Some graphical glitches (should be easily patched) - Texture pop-in is not a problem while on foot - catastrophic when driving at speed - If you want to sneak properly - you will NEED a controller  I would give this game 10/10 if not for the fps cap and glitches and brain dead AI   Worth buying if on sale, NOT worth it in its current state at full price.

EDIT: The game has now been updated to include the new framerate options. It definitely plays much better although it still needs optimizations but considering how fast they pushed out the fps update I have no doubt optimizations will be coming soon. When playing with the 60 or unlimited framerate options I recommend using vsync as the screen tearing at this point in time can be pretty bad. I&#39;ll continue to update my review as I play and hopefully I can work towards a recommendation once I play more.  Let&#39;s get the obvious out of the way. Yes the game is locked to 30fps but the developer has said they will be releasing an update with 30, 60, and unlocked fps options. They still don&#39;t get a free pass on launching it this way but at least they&#39;re not ignoring our complaints to fix it as fast as possible. With that being said, the only other major complaint I have with the visuals is that the game seems to be rendered at a much lower resolution than what you choose to natively display it as. I can&#39;t prove this fact but with how incredibly blurry the game is, even at higher resolutions (4k) It seems to be this way and I don&#39;t know if this can be improved or not.  Lack of visual options for user adjustment is a downside as everything ranges from low-high instead of giving us PC gamers what we are generally used to in terms of visual options. I should suggest that while other people have experienced crashes on a much higher scale, I have only crashed once so far so I have been lucky it seems.  On to the good stuff: -the game has a superb atmosphere that really captures the heart of the time the game takes place. And not just visually but the way people interact with you, cops always being supicious of you/etc really adds to the realism of the time. -music is awesome just as it was in Mafia II adding to the atmosphere once again -storytelling seems to be well thought out with great performances thus far as well as characters that are generally interesting -gunplay is solid although I do recommend turning off aim assist for the best experience -audio design outside of the soundtrack is great as well  General comments/personal preferences: -the driving is best when switched to simulation mode but it&#39;s still far from perfect. I don&#39;t mind it as much but you may hate the inconsistency of it -Ai needs some work. Open world games usually lack Ai that is well programmed or unique, this is no different, can be bad at times but don&#39;t let it detract from the overall story -play with a controller, your life will be much easier -collectibles are back! (Playboys :D, and others)   At its current state I would suggest most people wait until the game is fully patched up and fixes the major issues mentioned above, but for anyone who is either a fan of the series or isn&#39;t bothered by the 30fps cap that is currently enforced, pick it up but be aware you still and probably will run into issues.

My Review was Positive for 32.1 Hours of Playtime in Mafia 3. It had 88% Positive Feedback and i will re-post my old review when the main aspect of my negative Review is being fixed.  Look at the Discussion:    http://steamcommunity.com/app/360430/discussions/0/341537671995256038/   and    http://steamcommunity.com/app/360430/discussions/0/343788552553810086/    After you killed the &#39;Big Boss&#39; and can choose between Vito, Burke or Cassandra to give a district, there is one Mission where you cant progress. After the Mission: &#39;Burn Like Napalm&#39; which is quite lately at the end of the game you can choose to give one district to one of your crew. The Window doesnt pop up and you are stuck watching at Vito without making any progress.    Be aware that some people can make progress and finish the game but some people can&#39;t. Some People can&#39;t even start the Game. FIXES?

TL;DR Should you buy this? No. Not yet.  Although the trailers made me feel like this was going to be some generic &#39;you&#39;re a badass, work your way towards it&#39; game, the story is actually compelling and the characters are very interesting. Sadly though, that&#39;s the only reason to get this game so far.  It&#39;s like mafia 2, only worse. Graphically it&#39;s all drab and dark, there&#39;s no color or ambience like in Mafia 2, although it has some appeal for itself. Right now just expect minecraft graphics and you might be pleased with what you get; they downgraded the graphics and tried to compensate for it by spamming post processing effects.  You&#39;ll see out of place textures, effectes and objects that make the whole thing not feel like 1 world, but more like a world with objects in it placed by the dev.  Also it&#39;s worth noticing that the day and night cycle will appear in 2 seconds, literally. You&#39;ll see the sun flying past you on the ground and at least a second later it&#39;ll all go dark for nighttime, it&#39;s just broken.  I&#39;ve even had one occasion where it all went pitch black and eventually gained more and more brightness after 5 seconds of waiting, probably also an issue with the day/night cycle.  All in all this is a terrible port, they even had the balls to release it at a 30fps cap, which as now been removed. Sadly though, it&#39;s VERY noticable that the rest of the game hasn&#39;t been adjusted accordingly. You&#39;ll get a very poor framerate at a high end PC, resulting in something that looks WORSE than mafia 2.  How, you ask? Mafia 2 is outdated by now, this is a AAA next gen game. Well it&#39;s not any more impressive than Mafia 2 graphically. It&#39;s very clear when playing this that this was intended for consoles exclusively; textures are very drawn out and blurrish and one look at the skybox will reveal that it&#39;s a stretched out JPEG with no effort in it.  Heck, just look up some footage of a mirror in this game. It&#39;s a picture in picture screen with a 10 second delay. In english; this means if you look in a mirror after walking at it, you&#39;ll see yourself about 10 seconds ago. Wait for another 10 seconds and it might load the picture of you standing closer.    Game is full of bugs, and i do mean full. As an ArmA fanboy and Early access tester i&#39;ve never shyed away from bugs, even on a AAA title.  However in this game you&#39;ll see at least 50 of them within 30 minutes of playing. Dead enemies will ragdoll into walls and objects around you, melee kill animations will clip you, your opponent and your camera through walls and objects alike. Cars will teleport in front of you as a result of the console&#39;s intended view distance. My personal tip; never drive at full speed. A car will eventually spawn 1cm in front of you standing still and you&#39;ll have a deadly crash.   The AI is horrendous. I&#39;m not sure how scripted the AI in mafia 2 was, but it definitely seemed better than here. You can basically &#39;sneak&#39; at your enemy, AKA crouch-run at your enemy. If you react within 5 seconds of him seeing you, you can still press control to slide lincoln into cover at the enemy&#39;s feet. He&#39;ll then be like &#39;what&#39;s that sound&#39; instead of &#39;why is there a huge ♥♥♥ african-american war hero sliding past me&#39;, and as a result you can easily press Q to kill him.  As for the cops; they&#39;re on the &#39;broken AI&#39; bandwagon. You can drift diagonally across 4 lanes at an intersection with 2 patrol cars and 4 officers on foot watching you, you&#39;ll get a blue marker indicating they&#39;re &#39;about&#39; to get alerted, but they won&#39;t. They won&#39;t chase you if you speed, they won&#39;t chase you if you cut them off in incoming traffic, they won&#39;t chase you if you drift like a maniac.  They will, however, immediately pull their weapons and start firing at you if you slightly hit something. The good old bribing and them attempting to arrest you at first is history. It&#39;s mafia 3; it&#39;s dumbed down, so don&#39;t expect any details like the ones you got in mafia 2.  Stealth is no challenge whatsoever, i&#39;m challenging myself to do the entire playthrough guns blazing, although i&#39;m generally a massive fan of stealth gameplay.   Gameplay and graphics wise it feels like a letdown from mafia 2.  Storywise and characterwise however; it&#39;s definitely worth it. That is if the game gets fixed or deserted and discounted down to 20 bucks. Don&#39;t pick it up for any higher price for now.

How the F do releases like this keep getting put out over and over again where there are horrid issues to begin with? I&#39;m very much looking forward playing this when it gets fixed but right now there is no way I can play it when the graphics are so muddy. My vision is bad enough I&#39;m not going to slog through this mess. They even muddied up the Steam overlay. HOW? Perhaps I&#39;ll change my review when it is fixed and can &#39;see&#39; what an awesome game it is, perhaps not because really junk like this needs to be punished.  Edit 10/29/2016: After 3 weeks and 50+ hours of play I do like the gameplay but the poor performance and graphics persist. The promised patch was released quickly but didn&#39;t seem to improve a single thing. I can max out graphics or set them to low and get exactly the same poor performance and muddy graphics. Even the audio quality is poor with popping and to make it even half way reasonable sounding you have to lower the quality of your entire PC&#39;s audio to minimal. To add to the problems is a very confusing mission progression system where you have missions available but they&#39;re not really available because you haven&#39;t done something in the game yet which would actually allow that mission to be played. For example, you might have a mission to steal a truck or boat or whatever and you spend lots of time getting to that objective only to find out it isn&#39;t there because there is something else you need to do first and the game does little to nothing in explaining how this works. So you spend lots of time driving around to play missions that can&#39;t be played. I&#39;ll keep powering through the game but had I been in a refund situation to begin with I never would have kept it. I do love this franchise and hope they get their stuff fixed.

EDIT: I decided to refund this, but I will leave the original review at the bottom. I can&#39;t pay for this and I feel bad for the developers because I don&#39;t think any of them wanted to release this game as unfinished as it currently is. Characters, animations and especially the facial animation are really high quality. Soundtrack and sound design is awesome. Storytelling is great and story itself seems really good. Everything points out that they were making an awesome high quality game, but there are a lot of things that seem to be unfinished or need some polish. Physics are wonky and don&#39;t work correctly. Lighting has issues and there is flickering and weird reflections. Textures are really low quality by todays standard. AI is dumb, game is full of glitches and is crashing from time to time. 30fps is not acceptable but the limit is not my biggest issue with the game and I don&#39;t believe that all of the issues are going to be fixed in future patches. Locking fps to 30 also hints that the optimization is also only half done. I am disappointed.   ---ORIGINAL REVIEW---  After quick testing I can throw in a few pros and cons:   PROS  - Story seems good. - Characters and character/facial animations are well made. - Soundtrack is amazing!! - Driving is pretty good when set to simulation. - Cutscenes, overall feel and also the collectibles!   CONS  - Locked to 30fps which is NOT enough for a pleasant experience. - Way too much handholding: Button prompts and floating markers everywhere and I found no option to turn those off. Collectibles are marked on the minimap and even highlighted with an icon when nearby. - Low res textures here and there and very low res reflections on vehicles. Chrome on the bumpers/trims especially looks horrible! Car models are not that high quality and seem to have weird reflections. - Traffic pop-in at distance. - Graphics generally are not that great excluding the characters. There is a blurry feel overall even when the Depth of Field, Motion Blur and Anti-Aliasing are turned off. - Sun/clouds are working weird. When driving around everything will suddenly go dark and then bright again. Ofcourse this is how it works irl when clouds cover the sun but the effect ingame is way too fast. - Guns seemed to be frustratingly inaccurate when shooting medium to high range, even if you shoot one round at the time. I only had little time with guns so this was really the first impression.   VERDICT  I want to like this game. I am a huge fan of the previous games, but the more I play this one the more disappointed I get. Story and characters seem ok, but everything else feels like its half complete. I can&#39;t really enjoy the game with framerate locked to 30 and it makes some of the cons seem worse, but that is not the only problem with this. I &#39;hope&#39; that this was just released too early and future patches will fix all the graphical issues and not only remove the framerate lock. I will revisit this review if I get a reason to do so, but it&#39;s not looking very good...

Review in progress - game on hold until patch(es)...  So far:  The story itself looks exciting - I really like the documentary style, the characters and the atmosphere is promising. But this game suffers from major issues.  The 30 FPS lock will be the least of our problems (never should have been there in the first place), the graphics doesn&#39;t look as good as it should be, low quality textures everywhere. There is also a constant blurriness which spoils the look of the game even further. Suffers from lots of minor (but annoying) bugs, full of glitches and other issues (regarding both graphics and gameplay).   The AI is stupid, sorry there isn&#39;t any, this &#39;openworld&#39; gameplay must be a joke in 2016. Watch_Dogs seems like GTA6 compared to this game.  All of the problems mentioned above could have been avoided if they take some extra time to polish the game and delay it for a couple of months.  Will update the review when I finish the game, until then I can&#39;t recommend it.

I just nominated this mess for The &#39;Biggest Disappointment&#39; Award.   2K Czech made the Mafia series great, Hangar 13 took everything great about it and threw it out the window.  I had really high expectations for Mafia III, and to call it a disappointment is an understatement.  I feel that they took too much inspiration from other titles and kept too little of what the first games in the series great. I&#39;m not saying everything they added is bad, some of it is great, but some of it is terrible and executed even worse.   Gameplay:  They showed us a badass trailer but nothing that happened in the trailer happened in game. In the trailer it looks like you will have the gang with you causing mayhem in the city of New Bordeaux, but in the game they actually just sit on their ♥♥♥ the whole time while you do all the heavy lifting. The game want&#39;s you to believe you&#39;re in charge of your 3 underbosses, but in reality you&#39;re running around doing everything for them.  Shooting in the game is decent enough but with only 2 weapons, it feels like they really want you to go stealth. Stealth is almost too easy, you can just whistle and knock people out all day.  Some UI elements feel very unnecessary, signs popping up along the road telling you the direction to drive, and sings hovering over weapons saying there is a weapon on the ground.  The sandbox elements in the game are rather pointless. Many buildings to break into is a cool idea, but when every building looks exactly the same inside it becomes boring pretty quickly. You can also break into junction boxes and wiretap them, so you can see all enemies in the area trough walls and all collectible items on the map.  There is a few different types of stores around the city, liquor stores, diners and such. But they have no purpose other than for you to steal money from, no clothing stores and no garages to modify your car. And since this is the future and you don&#39;t need gasoline, gas stations are only there to explode even if you didn&#39;t crash into anything. There&#39;s also no garage for you to store your favorite cars in like Mafia 2, now you call with your cellphone no I mean radio of course, and someone will deliver a car to you.  Driving in this game is so weird it almost feels like the car isn&#39;t moving, just the ground and camera. There is almost no difference what speed you have if you crash, even at low speed the screen gets red like you&#39;re about to die, but don&#39;t take any damage. Trying to drive from the road up to the pavement is not always an easy task, sometimes it goes smoothly, but sometimes it&#39;s like hitting a wall. The cars doesn&#39;t really get that banged up either, just a few dents and broken lights, but all of a sudden the engine explodes.  The AI is so stupid it&#39;s hard not to laugh at them, and even your allies will drive you down.   Controls:  No jumping is okay, but the movements of the character is so limited and you can&#39;t walk up or climb over so many of the obstacles.  I have still not done many brutal takedowns, because I just can&#39;t figure out how to do them.   Graphics:  First of, Mafia 2 came out 6 years ago and I don&#39;t see not much improvement in graphics. The lighting looks really great at times, but suddenly it is bugged and looks horrible.  Mafia was originally released only on PC. Here we have yet another poorly optimized port, but it has so many issues beside that. The 30 fps cap was nothing compared to how aged this game feels even though it came out just a few days ago. I also feel like the graphics options in this game is very limited. Just look at how Rockstar worked on optimizing GTA V for PC before they released it. It has a long list of options and it runs smoothly on older computers and looks way better than Mafia III.   Sound:   The sound is all over the place and I hear tire squealing shifting from ear to ear all the time, and sometimes in firefights it sounds like people shooting and screaming on the left, when there is nobody there. It might be a little less noticeable with speakers but with headphones it&#39;s really distracting  The soundtrack is superb. So many good tracks to drive around to.   Story:  The story is told in a documentary style and reminds me of the first Mafia. I just wish we got to know some characters more, I&#39;m supposed to avenge some people I barly know.  The story is a bit short and I feel like I did the same thing over and over again in the side missions and the story missions were over way too fast.  I really like the setting and the feel of 1968 New Bordeaux, I just feel they put too much technology and science fiction in it.   Bugs:  The game is full of bugs and glitches: floating items, sinking cars, AI running in circles, AI driving in circles, double render of Cassandra. And many many more.

I hate seeing pathetic people bashing a good title only because of an uncaught last-minute bug that wasn&#39;t supposed to happen, and that will be fixed soon.  The game is pretty damn great, just what you&#39;d expect from sequel to Mafia 2. It focuses heavily on the story and overall feeling rather than being a GTA clone. Yes, it is open-world, simplified, and of course some things could be done better, but I don&#39;t have enough arguments to criticize the game - it&#39;s decent. I didn&#39;t play long enough to write a full review yet, perhaps I&#39;ll edit it later on, but so far game met my initial expectations, and I&#39;m happy to recommend it to all Mafia fans, especially those that didn&#39;t consider Mafia 2 to be a failure.  I&#39;d give it strong 7/10, maybe more when I actually go through the whole story by finishing it.  // Promised edit  The game took me 51 hours to finish, with everything you can do, from completing all missions to picking up all collectibles. Sadly, I must admit that the few last hours of my playthrough were feeling like being forced to see the ending. The game is repetitive to some awful degree, and even I got enough of it at the end. It&#39;s like a mix of really well written narrative story, with repetitive gameplay and lack of idea what to do with it. I still recommend the title, but my rating will actually go down, to something like 6.5/10, mainly because I wasn&#39;t expecting that repetitive playthrough - from my 51 hours at least 30 looked exactly the same as first 5, resulting in barely 10 hours of actual unique playthrough, rest felt a little like content-filling garbage that made the game longer.  I&#39;d say pick it up if you&#39;re fan of Mafia 2, you definitely won&#39;t be disappointed by the story, but depending on how much of optional activity you want to do, you might feel really tired by the end of the game. 6.5/10.

So if you played Mafia 1 and 2 this will be extremely disappointing. This doesn&#39;t offer even close to the same experience as far as being a mobster, in fact you play a character taking apart a mafia in Louisiana. If there is one place that doesn&#39;t remind me of the Italian Mafia, it&#39;s Louisiana... They start the game with a disclaimer stating that they don&#39;t agree with racism which tells me that the vast majority if not all of people making the game are white and have little to no experience with actual people of other races and possibly even white southerners. I can safely say that every black person I know would have offered the feedback to the rest of the team saying, don&#39;t put that in there it makes you sound stupid. I could go on about that but it&#39;s not even close to the worst part of the game. They basically just made a Grand Theft Auto San Andreas clone based in the 60s/70s, this isn&#39;t Mafia, this is GTA. There isn&#39;t any class to it, there isn&#39;t anything remotely Italian to it. They take the main character from Mafia II and make him an ancillary throw away character who really could have been anybody. There is almost no character development in the story save for exposition by third parties in cut scenes that really aren&#39;t necessary and quite honestly become annoying as hell after the first few times they happen, but never end.   You know what I&#39;m not going to put any more effort into this review than they did in making the game. So short answer, don&#39;t buy it unless it&#39;s on sale.

From my point of view - it&#39;s a shame the entire series.   The game does not match the previously stated quality. During the game you start to realize that it was made in 2005, by indie developers in a basement which is located in the suburbs of Pyongyang  Mafia 3 is a hoax and an attempt to steal from fans of the series as much money as possible for a pacifier.  This game doesn&#39;t deserve to be the heir of a series of games Mafia.

I do not recomand the game,is just feel unfinished,unpolished.Apart from the 30 FPS lock the textures look blurry and one of the biggest problem for me is the lighting system beeing to dark or to shiny,switching suddenly from cloudy to sunny and all that is becoming tiring for the eyes very fast. And the handling in not simulated in any way especially that there is not a speed limiter like in Mafia 2 to just cruize along.   https://s13.postimg.org/sebb3a3uf/mafia3_2016_10_07_17_41_19_19.jpg    https://s21.postimg.org/3sgxhqz2f/mafia3_2016_10_07_18_02_41_40.jpg   https://s22.postimg.org/buz7lg96p/mafia3_2016_10_07_18_02_54_44.jpg    https://s21.postimg.org/7hwe9zdmv/mafia3_2016_10_07_18_04_22_08.jpg   https://s12.postimg.org/8a0wer5tp/mafia3_2016_10_07_18_04_25_46.jpg

970gtx 30-70 frames depending what your doing in the game , graphic arnt wow.. they are like ok  update: serveral bugs and crashes.... and really struggling to finish this game its that boring ... its one of those games where you get nothing out of it and keep waiting for something redeemable then spend so much time on it you feel you have to finish it... i would say dont even get this game get mafia 2 may not have as good graphics... but its twice the game that mafia 3 is...    playing what i have played so far capturing two whole terrorities ,this game doesnt live up to mafia 2 infact its a step backwards in many ways... you will know if you played mafia 2 before  also if your playing this because of the whole back mob thing thinking it wil be a new different kind of mob story... when your really think about it you could be playing as a white dude... yes there is racism to make you feel like your killing these dudes because of that... but its a poor attempt...  the game doesnt feel as dynamic as mafia 2 for reasons ill list below...  1. the mechanics dont feels as dynamic as mafia 2... there is something off about it i cant put my finger on it ... maybe its the fact you cant repair your engine or it doesnt die... car damage feels off i feel like i can smash into a brick wall and still drive. police dont turn up after you rob someone and corner off the building... police dont feel as aggressive.. dont set up roadblocks... dont chase you if you speed, dont stop or chase you just because they feel like it (racism?)  2. the story is super repeatitive .... like kill a bunch of dudes over and over .. collect this... yes the cutscenes tie it together (but they are starting to become a bore) but the rest of the game feels like a drag... theres no thing like (mafia 2 spoiler) rescue leo cos the mob is about to kill and also your friend is doing the hit act fast.... the story tied with the gameplay just feels a little bland  3. i dont feel any emotion for lincoln like i did vito... personally... this is possible because its a bit of a grind to play where as mafia ever bit felt like you where experiencing his life doing things for reasons... earning money for reasons... this revenge story feels drawn out... vito doesnt feel like the vito we know either ...but maybe he has changed over the years who knows.. so id allow for that ... he feels more of a ♥♥♥♥ you vito... i dont care about anyone ... whereas in mafia two he cared about his family joe ect...  4. although the map is big personally i got bored of the map quick especially with all the run here do this missions.. i ended up skipping the side missions because i could tell after doing three sets of them they were completely boring ... the only reason to spend your time with it is cutscenes with the side characters  good things about the game.. are soundtrack, cutscenes.... and maybe story but i cant be arsed to grind through this to play all of it...    i recommended this game on a sale and if you dont mind grinding a bit .... good played in little bits when only doing story missions...

A big dissapointment.. I&#39;d rather buy it on sales period after 6 months or so. TOO many bugs, the missions repeatble in the same numb sequence. The crews after every racket capture are same regardles their boss, only their colors change. The story though and the numbers of missions are kinda sufficient though. Nevertheless , its a very, very sloppy outcome.

I&#39;ve played Mafia I, II and now this. The game looks rubbery, its extremely boring and repetive, graphics are bad and the city is not lively. This game consists of mostly grinding, assasins creed style district takeover. No soul, no true story or advancement. Everything this game consists of is repetitions and grinding. Only a few characters that have any personality or life, rest is just gray mass, for example: Holding up a drug dealer versus a high end mafia man in a mission, both act the exact same way, both areas are setup the same way enemy wise and you ALWAYS have to do the SAME thing, run up to the target and press Q, its always the same, knife on the throat and same dialogues. The game is dead, its a ripoff and a huge letdown for the erlier Mafias. You ruined a great game series with this. This is just constant NOTHING. the game makes you feel empty. And last words, this has _nothing_ to do with what Mafia games are about. This has nothing to do with Mafia, this game is about a PTSD Vietnam veteran who snapped and is brutally killing everybody. Btw, after stabbing 100 persons with the Q button, you get so bored of him cutting open throats and sticking the knife into people. Its not classy like erliers where, its plain, repetive and the last and the most horrific, its _ARCADE_. You are constantly following ONSCREEN advice and MARKERS, it takes the last bit of fun out of the game, its so arcade, so easy and so handheld game that it hurts and insults me. Please, do not buy this game, you will feel bad for supporting this ripoff, the producers are not even trying anymore, stop buying ♥♥♥♥ thats coated in glitter.

Well i guess i&#39;m already at a certain point in the game where i can tell, yes, Mafia 3 is long overdue awaited.  A true polar noir game, with amazing 60&#39;s atmosphere, a great story, that slowly moves in.  A game that has its own identity, really, and that&#39;s what&#39;s so good. U feel like playing a enterely new GTA-Like, with its own rights.  Guess i&#39;m hooked now, need to unfold the story to the end.

I try to be an optimist in my life as much as possible. I don’t find it enjoyable to be a pessimist and be cynical about everything. That’s why I’m going to try and look at Mafia III as a glass-half-full kind of game. The good parts of Mafia are really tremendous but the bad parts are equally as frustrating.  Mafia III follows the, dare I say it, “underrated” Mafia II released in 2010. Mafia II followed the story of Vito Scaletta as he rose through the ranks of the mob and told a really compelling and gripping story. The narrative was tight with great characters but had one nearly universal criticism; the gameplay. Mafia II was an open world game that didn’t need to be open world. There were prolonged amounts of having to drive from point A to B with no real reason to do so. You couldn’t interact with the rest of the world and there was nothing else to see, so it was literally just a waste of time. Unfortunately, Mafia III follows this same path.  Mafia III takes place in fictional Louisiana in 1968, with the biracial, Vietnam vet Lincoln Clay in the lead role. That’s a lot to digest right there; late 60’s, racism, the Vietnam War. Mafia III puts a whole heck of a lot on its plate and attempts to finish it all. I would say that the devs at Hangar 13 do quite a deft job of navigating the themes and issues of the time while taking them head on without beating you over the head with it or coming off as offensive. Their depiction of racism during this time is done in a believable way. Yes, there is a gratuitous amount of racial slurs thrown around, but as the disclaimer at the beginning of the game says, it’s done to be accurate to the times and not to diminish or shy away from what people went through.  The characterization in Mafia III is really great, giving you characters you can empathize with as well as ones that you loathe. They give Lincoln Clay an interesting backstory and mostly make great use of it in a revenge story that doesn’t feel cliché.  Mafia III’s story provides a great foundation yet it’s the game’s design that really shows its cracks. Now I know that game design is a tough job and I don’t want to come across like an armchair quarterback but the mission designer really dropped the ball here. With the exception of a handful, the majority of the mission structures in Mafia are exactly the same. You need to weaken a Racket so you go to [insert building here] and either kill or interrogate the boss at that site as well as destroy any contraband and take any money that’s there. While there are permutations and different settings, that’s effectively what the game is. I think it goes without saying that it can get a tad bit monotonous. Thankfully, the gunplay and the stealth are good enough that you can mix up and vary your play style to keep things from getting stale. I was specifically impressed by how viable of an option the stealth was, which is almost unheard of in a GTA-style open world game. There were numerous missions where I ghosted the whole place and didn’t fire a single shot.  The other design choice that left me scratching my head was no fast travel. It’s 2016, what the hell. Now I’m not necessarily for games being easier, I know some people appreciate hard games, but what I have little to no tolerance for is a game that wastes my time. The developers here seemingly left out fast travel for no other reason than to pad the game’s length. Much like Mafia II, there’s no reason for me to stop anywhere while I’m driving to a destination. My eyes nearly got stuck the amount of times I rolled them back as the game wanted me to go from one side of the map to the other. That’s simply insulting to me as a consumer. I will say though that the driving is damn fun. Perhaps the best open world driving I’ve experienced. So while I may have complaints with the lack of fast travel, having to drive everywhere didn’t really wear on me until the very end because the car handling was so sublime.  Mafia III was a game that I was hoping would be in my GOTY discussion. Sadly, it’s not there and it’s not even particularly close. But that does not mean that it’s a bad game. The narrative and the characters that are presented are top notch and are what kept me coming back and driving (literally) through the so-so gameplay to reach its finale. I recommend people play Mafia III because, without sounding trite, it’s a bold and brave move for a AAA game to have a black protagonist and deal with the themes and issues that it does. But with that recommendation comes a caveat; know what you’re getting into. If you think that the nature of the mission structure will not bother you, then there is a ton of fun to be had here. Is it worth $60? Absolutely not, but if you can get it around $20 then I think there’s enough there to satisfy. I wouldn’t have played it for 23 hours had I not enjoyed it.

**First Impression**  At this point in time i can&#39;t recommend Mafia III. It doesn&#39;t feel like a Mafia to me at all. It feels really choppy and the controlls feel...weird... driving also does not feel like Mafia games used to feel. To quick, cops don&#39;t care about going to fast/passing red lights..well at least they never wanted to give me a ticket yet, which was one of THE features i got hyped about in the first Mafia for some reason.   Also it looks...♥♥♥♥ in my eyes at least. First time i started it up it looked like some game from the early 2000s to me. Graphic settings were set to &#39;optimal&#39; which was the standard config, so i switched to custom and upped everything to the max.... didn&#39;t see much of a difference happening.

Mafia III comes strong out of the gate but then slows down and turns into a marathon grind. Many features that you would expect to be in the game are noticably absent (some are promised in future patches) and while the core gameplay of driving and shooting is satisfying, how they are executed in the game is pretty lame. Repetitive missions for each district require you to do the same 4 activities before you can challenge the racket bosses which allow you to challenge the capo. The 4 activities are: Kill some people, destroy some things, interrogate some people, or steal some things. Nothing else.  The game does contain some very notable bright spots. The representation of the location, a New Orleans-clone in 1968 Louisiana, is beautifully depicted and contains the institutional bigotry and racism that were a horrendous hallmark of the era. The characters can be compelling and interesting and the cutscenes are like watching a movie, engrossing you in the story&#39;s progression. As stated before, the shooting and driving mechanics are fun and even though it&#39;s a typical cover-based shooter, it feels more satisfying as you use your pistol to snipe shot someone 50 yards away (kind of like the AI does in other games...). The cars handle better than refrigerators on wheels, but still lack the finesse of cars with power steering. It&#39;s that delicate balance that makes driving enjoyable. Also the period soundtrack is amazing, although I&#39;m kind of disappointed that Jimi Hendrix&#39;s &#39;All Along the Watchtower&#39; is only played during the opening menu... Any fan of 1960s music will appreciate the soundtrack in the game.  Missing features plague the game to keep it from being a truly enjoyable experience. The lack of a home base to store cars, change outfits, collect earn, or even upgrade to spend money on, kind of makes the experience pretty hollow. It feels less like you&#39;re running a criminal organization and more like you&#39;re just running around killing mostly racist people in your linear quest for revenge. 2K did say that they were going to patch in character customization (e.g. the ability to change outfits), but that should have already been included from the start. Even the 60+ FPS framerate needed a patch that was released a day after the game came out. Why 2K feels the need to patch these things in at a later time is beyond me. You should not be paying $60+ dollars for an incomplete product.  Mafia III is best enjoyed in short bursts, grinding out a racket or two in between other games. I hoped that 2K wouldn&#39;t be patching in features at a later date, but it seems like that&#39;s what you&#39;re going to have to wait for. Don&#39;t buy it in its current state for full price. Wait for the new features to be patched in and then buy it. It can be an enjoyable experience and hopefully once it&#39;s complete, the game will live up to the potential that was laid down from the beginning.  Pros: - Good setting - Combat/Driving is fun - Decent main storyline, when you&#39;re not grinding it out - Good voice acting - Great soundtrack  Cons: - Incredibly stupid driver/pedestrian AI - Enemy AI is pretty shaky - Repetitive grinding for Rackets/Bosses/Capos - No character customization (promised in later patch) - No car storage - No hideout - Repetitive animations - Wonky weather system - Dated graphics - Graphical glitches - Couple of crashes (3 so far at the time of writing this review) - Feels rushed and unfinished  [Update: The devs have patched in outfit customization and car customization. But for me, it feels a little too late. I&#39;ve already beaten the game and I really have no desire to go back and grind out the game just for the features they should have added in before release. I think starting now, it would be a good game to buy, on sale, at least 25% off. 2K needs to be punished for not releasing a complete game and foolishly giving them full price for an incomplete game, like I did, just rewards the bad behavior and will encourage them to do it later.]

The game is technical tragedy. It lags, crashes and looks like a game from 2007. Also a 30fps lock, which is UNACCEPTABLE on PC.  Too bad, because the game itself is really fun, and the story is good.  They will probably fix it, but you can launch your game only once, and Mafia 3 blew it. Fix it.

The story seems great, but the game is of so low quality that it hurts. It feels like the developers never ever tried the game on PC. So far I&#39;ve had crashes, buttons that I&#39;m supposed to press that&#39;s not working(and then the only way is to kill the game, cause settings are then disabled). Tha game graphics also seems strange but still heavy to run.  This game seems rushed and unfinished, but it might become a great game if they put some time into fixing stuff.

Mafie is not a great game. It&#39;s not even a good one. It&#39;s okay.  It&#39;s two years past (god, it turned out to be 3 already) we got GTA V and it&#39;s main competitors didn&#39;t capture what makes such games awesome.  It&#39;s a combination of interesting characters, fresh story and well though mechanics.  Unfortunately, Mafia 3 gets not more than 6 out of 10 on all of this points.  Characters are pretty stereotypical, considering ongoing political agenda. U got rough but means good black guy, you got sneaky and cocky CIA operative, you get couple italian, irish and black allies. And all of the enemies are sick ♥♥♥♥♥♥ in one or the other way. Plus exactly one main character in each side is woman. 4/10  Story is also quite boring. Seen multiple times &#39;I&#39;ll revenge death of my close ones, while deciding weather i&#39;m good or bad person&#39;. Side quests are written pretty good. You get the feel of the era, but that&#39;s about it. Final twists are actually great, but they do not overcome all the boredome of 30+ hours (2 first hours and last one are good). 6/10  Mechanics is the worst here. It seems developers got lazy or cocky or put into position of rushing the game, so you basically have couple very boring things to do. Drive around, kill or kinda-kill-interrogate (shoot, until he knees, then hold one button, then actually kill him), do it 5-10 times, kill mini-boss (same as interrogation), do all of this twice, get district, assign it to one of your allies, get some quire irrelevant perk, do it all over again 8 more times.   And yeah, to maximize your profits you actually have to drive at least 18 times all across other end of the map, make routin kill of everyone around, get into the truck and slowly ride all the way back. Oops, 20 minutes just went out of the window 17 of which are dull driving. And there is no fast travel at all.  Finishers are dull, it feels like it&#39;s 15-20 of them. Stealth gets really boring fast. Takes too much time without getting things easier. You can just stay in distance and shoot everyone with best gun you have unlocked so far.   Ocassionally you get some interesting cutscene or minigame like boxing or untying yourself, but that&#39;s it. 3/10  And I get it. It&#39;s hard to develop a lot of new and fresh mechanics on every corner of the game. Learn from GTA then. Script some great missions over and over again. Put a bomb under car. Poision drugs. Wreck a train. Steal some fuel from airport. Swap cash for guns deal. Smoke out some people on a factory. Put some fun dialogues while you driving.   But you get nothing.  Game tries to be engaging, educational, eye-opening, atmospheric, dynamic, a bit of strategic and economical, a bit of RPG and raising some moral questions. Instead it turned out to be dull and cliched.  Don&#39;t waste your money or what&#39;s most important - time. Go play GTA or FarCry 3 if you still haven&#39;t.

Absolutely waste of money if you think you&#39;re buying anything like the last 2 games.  Where to even begin on this money grabbing train wreak.  First of, the glitches and the bugs that are so painfully apparent in the game that should have been fixed long before release. First released on 30 FPS then an update made to reach 60.  The weather and day night system is so broken it&#39;s not funny, you can be driving at night one moment and then suddenly be driving in day the next, only to return to night a second later with completely random rain.  Secondly, there is no point in this game being open world exploration at all, the money you make can only buy weapons and ammo, there is no changing of attire, upgrading cars (I know that is coming later but it&#39;s so insanely stupid that it&#39;s not apart of the original product) No other interaction beside story line quests.  This is pathetic compared to the last 2, it&#39;s your standard triple A money grabbing peice of trash. Do your self a favour and do not buy this.  0/10

Cannot recommend this game currently, which is a shame considering how much I was looking forward to playing it. Locked frame rate of 30fps for ANY PC game is unforgivable as far as I&#39;m concerned, give people the chance to lock the framerate themselves but don&#39;t not give an option in the first place! The graphics just seem...washed out and blurry like I&#39;m playing the game looking through frosted glass and more like a playstation 3 port at current state. The attention to the little details also which immerse you in games like these in the little while I&#39;ve played, seem poor. For example I&#39;ve walked past three mirrors in Sammy&#39;s bar, not one reflection, so either secretly Lincoln is a vampire or they just forgot about those little details. Hopefully things will improve with a patch, but we shouldn&#39;t have to expect that from every game which comes out, which sadly it seems more often the case now than not. If you were looking forward to this game, give it a miss for now and wait for a patch or two.

Oh well this game is so limited if it comes to physics, graphics, game settings. It&#39;s just terrible. 30FPS lock did I mentioned that? ;)   The open world is not sdo open and is very limited. Do not expect to be able to do even half of the things you can do in GTA V. GTAV thta is the proper open wirld game. Not this one.  Textures in this game and details... OMG it&#39;s just terrible.   I do not own top end game rig but it is not that bad either. GTX970, i7 4790K, 16GB of 1600MHz RAM, and the games crashes and stutters from time to time.   The game lookd really awful but the only thing that keeps me going is the story. The story is great. The rest is just not even medicore. If you&#39;re OK with that, oh well buy it. If I would knew what I know already I would wait for a sale which will probably will happen soon as the reviews are not so good...  It&#39;s your call guys but I would recommend to wait fro a sale...

No UI Scaling No Cloud Saves  Even after the patch with dual 1080s the game struggles to hit 60 FPS.  People are saying that the story becomes repetitive, I have to say that I am not sure as I have not gone through it enough to find out and at this point I have stopped playing until at least the 3 issues above are rectified.   At this point in time, I definitely do not recommend it. A very bad port that makes you think you are actually living in 1968  EDIT: Engrish.

Just a precursor to this review, I grew up playing the original Mafia back in the early 2000&#39;s and I have Mafia II for both my Xbox 360 and PC. I remember purchasing Mafia II right at release six years ago and within the first few minutes of gameplay, I fell in love with the game. Mafia II still remains one of my favorite games to this day and I&#39;m sure I&#39;ve spent hundreds of hours throughout the years playing it on my 360.   Mafia III failed to captivate me like the first two games did. The most prominent flaw lies within the art design. While the cutscenes look great, the in-game graphics at max settings, 1440p look like something out of 2006. Blurry textures, horrible lighting, poor render resolution, ♥♥♥♥ yellow filter (which can&#39;t be turned off), and way too much fog are some of the most noticeable problems. Paired with terrible framerate, braindead AI, and clunky keyboard and mouse controls, this game is a major disappointment for me. Mafia II from 2010 actually looks and plays better than its successor which came out six years later. Mafia III&#39;s story and gameplay may very well be good but the technical issues are bad enough that I don&#39;t want to force myself to keep playing. Oh, and if the capped framerate wasn&#39;t bad enough, SLI doesn&#39;t work either so one of my graphics cards is acting as an expensive paper weight right now. Suck my unit, 2k. You killed one of my favorite series. Refunded.

 Mafia 3 has so far been an all round positive experience for me.   - I only just meet the minimum requirements and the game runs fine.  - The graphics are decent even on low settings. - The game has not yet crashed nor have I experienced any bugs/glitches. - So far the story is both gripping and exciting.  Overall in the short time I have played I think it&#39;s much better than its predecessor.   I suggest you ignore most of the negative reviews as it&#39;s just people complaining about the 30 fps cap, despite the fact it&#39;s going to be patched this weekend.

This is the first Mafia game I have played, everyone raved about the previous story lines so I thought I&#39;d give it a go. How dissapointing. It doesn&#39;t run well, is riddled with bugs (cars floating without wheels etc) and is mediocre at best. The story seems to bump along and the world is lifeless. Why didn&#39;t I just load up GTA V again..?! I can&#39;t get a refund but luckily I didn&#39;t pay full price. I can&#39;t recommend this and I can&#39;t see how it will be improved even with patches, so save your money and play some GTA instead.

As the old proverb goes, revenge is a dish best served cold. But for Mafia 3&#39;s Lincoln Clay, revenge is a dish best served with buckets of blood, preferably prepared using a razor sharp combat knife. Betrayed and left for dead by the Italian mob, Lincoln subsequently sets out on the warpath, hellbent on exacting vengeance upon those who wronged him and destroyed his family. That means dismantling mafia don Sal Marcano&#39;s sprawling criminal empire across the city of New Bordeaux one piece at a time.  Wiping out Marcano&#39;s criminal rackets is at the heart of Mafia 3&#39;s story, as Lincoln and his chain-smoking CIA insider John Donavan set about bringing down enforcers, lieutenants and capos, before going after the big man himself. However, there&#39;s more to do beyond simply getting to Marcano, meaning Lincoln requires the help of underbosses Cassandra, Vito Scaletta and Thomas Burke. As you recruit each of these lieutenants, you&#39;ll gain a variety of perks like an arms dealer, a consigliere to collect your cash, a hit squad to help out in a fight or vehicle delivery, but retaining these means keeping your underbosses happy.  As you gain control of each of New Bordeaux&#39;s rackets, you&#39;ll assign them to whichever underboss you like, before calling a sit down to decide who inherits the entire district. It&#39;s up to you whether you favour one or two of your underbosses, or take a more diplomatic approach, divvying turf up equally between all three. Failing to keep an underboss happy, however, will push them out, turning them into an enemy that Lincoln will have to deal with. It means the decisions you make during sit downs can have real consequences, so you&#39;ll need to choose wisely.  There are some facets of Mafia 3 that you&#39;ll need to think about then, although for the most part, the game&#39;s missions are largely variations on the same objective, sending you into hostile territory to clear out criminal scumbags. Little things like wiretapping junction boxes using fuses also reveals enemy positions, other racket locations and collectibles in the region on the mini map, making life easier for yourself.  An accomplished cover shooter at its core, practically every one of the rackets you seize comes from clearing out heavily armed goons, whether via stealthy means or through a more gung-ho approach. As such, you can expect to be stacking up the bodies, murdering enforcers, interrogating informants who can be recruited if you&#39;d rather not kill them, and inflicting damage to the racket by destroying stashes of drugs, chemicals or whatever. It can actually get rather repetitive.  Thankfully, Mafia 3&#39;s shooter mechanics are fantastic, as are the rest of the game&#39;s open-world systems, like the fun driving model (that includes a more realistic &#39;simulation&#39; option that can be toggled on or off) or the brutal and gratifying melee combat. By the time you reach the latter stages of Mafia 3, you&#39;ll be a well-oiled killing machine, able to pull off brutal kills and headshots with aplomb.  Unfortunately, Mafia 3 is hampered by a whole litany of bugs and other issues, most of which are odd visual quirks, including some lighting weirdness, numerous instances of pop-in, nutty physics that send cars flying through the air off the slightest bump, character model glitches and regular occurrences where the AI behaves in laughably strange ways.  In fact, the AI in general can be rather shoddy, either seeing you through walls or passing you by completely without noticing you&#39;re there. It&#39;s a shame, because Mafia 3 is genuinely enjoyable despite its range of problems. The soundtrack too is utterly stellar stuff, delivering the best of 60s music and bringing its version of a tumultuous 1968 New Orleans to startling life. The tunes blaring out of the radio from the likes of The Rolling Stones, The Beach Boys, Creedence Clearwater Revival, Jimi Hendrix and others are one of the best bits of Mafia 3.  The game&#39;s excellent storyline also keeps things ticking along nicely, intercut with present day documentary-style sequences and Donovan&#39;s testimony telling the tale of Lincoln Clay&#39;s vengeful mission from the perspective of the people who were there at the time. It&#39;s a great narrative device, although there are certain scenes that recount what happened before you&#39;ve actually had the chance to play out the ensuing scenario.  Nonetheless, Mafia 3&#39;s story is fantastic, unflinchingly violent and authentic in its rendition of a turbulent time and place. Definitely not for the faint-hearted, Hangar 13&#39;s open-world is one that&#39;s riddled with rampant racism, sex, drugs and other criminal activities, covered in gritty detail that doesn&#39;t pull any punches. Where GTA revels in sharp satire and humour, Mafia 3 is a more serious beast, not shying away from any of the issues that ran through American culture at the time. From the moment you start the game up, there&#39;s a statement from Hangar 13 saying as much, warning that the offensive language and period is shown as it was, warts and all.  As for the achievements, there&#39;s a really good spread across all of Mafia 3&#39;s various aspects, but there are a couple thrown in there that require a second playthrough. For such an enormous open-world game, that seems a bit crappy, meaning only the most dedicated will bother to pursue the full 1000G. The majority are devoted to story progress and missions, pulling off feats in combat and taking over rackets, encouraging you to really get stuck in. A good list, overall.  A decent open-world game, despite its myriad issues and repetitious mission structure, Mafia 3 excels as a cover shooter and epic crime saga. The problems with the game are outweighed by how enjoyable it is to play, with its robust driving and combat, and remarkable rendition of 1960s America. Look past the bugs and you&#39;ll find that Mafia 3 is an uncompromisingly violent and well-told drama that also successfully depicts a snapshot of an abhorrent, intolerant society.

Overall I&#39;d say this is a game worth getting. It may not be worth $60 but it&#39;s still strong and I don&#39;t feel bad that I spent money on it.  PROS: - The Story: This game has one of the best stories an action game has had in recent memory. It&#39;s nice to play as a Black War Veteran Anti-Hero, it&#39;s a direction that hasn&#39;t been taken in many games in the past. It also features a cast of interesting characters (at least the ones of any significance to the story). Without spoiling too much the high point of the story is definitely the confrontation at the end between Clay and the villain; it is realistically one of my favorite moments in any video game. The story isn&#39;t perfect, it isn&#39;t as good as Mafia II&#39;s story and is sadly spread too far and few between by an abundance of repetitive (and unskippable) story missions that don&#39;t actually progress the plot. Overall though the story and characters are so well written that it has to be a plus.  -Combat: Combat is definitely improved in this game over its predecessors. The inclusion of the stealth and brutal execution mechanics are key points which make this a fun game to play. Nothing is more satisfying than brutally stabbing a mafiosa repeatedly in the face and then taking out his startled friend with a close range shotgun to the gut that sends him ragdolling back through the air.    There is also a great amount of flexibility in the combat tactics you can use in the game. Stealth, going in guns-a-blazing, and any mixture of the two are all valid and useable combat tactics in MAFIA III. It also is really rewarding to stealth through one of the racket missions just to sneak up on the man in charge and grab him before he knows what&#39;s going on. I do need to make note that the AI is pretty stupid, especialy when it comes to the stealth; they will often times look right past you and you can make them throw caution to the wind with a simple whistle to draw them to an area where you can stealth kill them with a simple press of the &#39;Q&#39; key. The flexibility doesn&#39;t just come in tactics either. There are a wide range of weapons and explosives to choose from. Although it is kind of lame that you have very limited ammo supplies (even with the upgrades) and additionally can only carry two weapons, one small arms and one large arms weapon. I found myself often times dropping the extremely overpriced weapons I had bought purely out of the lack of ammo supply. Regardless of these small issues the combat definitely felt improved over Mafia II.  - Exploration:  Exploring New Bordeaux in Mafia III is a lot of fun. Each area feels pretty different from any of the others which is crazy considering there are 10 different areas in the city. While exploration isn&#39;t very fruitful, aside from gathering collectibles (see cons), it is still enjoyable for explorations sake. If you want to be rewarded tangibly for exploring you may not enjoy the exploration but if you just enjoy virtual site seeing you&#39;ll have a good time.   -Soundtrack: The soundtrack is great. While I prefered Mafia II&#39;s soundtrack (jazz is my jam), the use of classic rock songs at specific points of the game was great. Also the twangy &#39;bayou&#39; music that plays during a lot of cutscenes and at the title screen is also great. It does a great job at establishing the setting and the subtle changes depending on actions are both articulate and well executed. I also enjoyed the brief moments where a jazzy song would come on, usually while checking out the map, but that is just me.  Intermediate: These are topics that weren&#39;t really positives but weren&#39;t really negatives either  Difficulty: I beat the game with relative ease on the hardest difficulty. It seems rather unbalanced to be quite honest. There were certain parts that were extremely difficult and others that were a breeze. These moments were generally outliers though, most of the game gave a challenge but not a frustrating one. The way the health and armor worked were also pretty unbalanced and annoying. Fully upgraded you have four health bars, but getting shot with a shotgun puts you down to about half of a bar, and then only that bar will refill unless you use medicine (which is extra annoying because the game insists on making medicine hard to come by when you need it and expensive to buy for how often you need to use it for it to be effective). Similarly the armor that you spent $3000 on would disappear after a shotgun shot and pistol shot combined. While it may be helpful in a few situations on the whole it doesn&#39;t really do too much. That being said, this was only really noticable at certain times. The challenge was generally pretty fair (except for two particular instances) and definitely made it difficult to try and storm in on an area guns blazing if there were many people there. As I said earlier I beat the game on the hardest difficulty, and while that wasn&#39;t the most difficult of accomplishments it is certainly better than many modern games I can think of that are just so frustratingly difficult on harder settings.   Driving: The driving in Mafia III feels pretty meh. A lot of the nuiance that existed in Mafia II was scrapped. Speed limiter was totally removed. One improvement though is that while the driving AI is still stupid, they look like geniuses compared to the drivers in Mafia II. One really annoying aspect of the driving is that you will often hit something and die but it isn&#39;t consistent. Sometimes you can get in a head on collision at max speed and live, others you hit a twig in a boat going 3/4 of max speed and die. This is definitely annoying when you make a lot of progress in a mission just to be set back to the last checkpoint for something stupid. I do have to say that driving really fast and with lots of drifting does feel great in this game, possibly better than it does in Mafia II. I should mention I was playing with the realistic driving settings on.  Cons:  Repetitive: By the end I was pretty much bored of doing the same old racket missions over and over again just to get to the Story missions in between. That being said it was worth it to grind through for the story. Nevertheless, I wish that they could have used more original ideas than the very common, go here, kill this person or destroy this stuff approach. Racket missions also completely lacked story elements. At first they were fun but you have to remember, there are 18 rackets to take over. It gets old. Also I should mention that all the side missions (Vito&#39;s were actually pretty cool but that was because if you played Mafia II you had a little insider information as to what was going on and you had motivation to do it) were ♥♥♥♥ing awful. Burke&#39;s specifically were terrible. Stealing multiple of the same car was so god damn annoying. Same thing with the missions you were given to boost rackets. There&#39;s only so many times you can steal a boat full of marijuana before it gets old.   Lack of Immersion and Customization In Mafia II you had to buy guns and clothes at stores, could store and customize cars, had to fill up cars with gas, and coulld stick up stores. It really sucks to come to Mafia III and see all those things gone. Lincoln is stuck in the same outfit the whole game (aside from story missions where a specific costume is given for the duration of the mission) and while he has stored cars, they are all unlocked and have to be called in, you don&#39;t have a garage that you retrieve them from as previously done. You also buy all your guns and ammo and upgrades from the back of a van that you call in which takes away from the Immersion as well. Empire Bay felt like a real city, New Bordeaux really didn&#39;t.  Collectables: They have no achievement or even in game benefit for collectors. They&#39;re in the way.  Summary: It plays very much like Saints Row 2 but more serious and story orientend than goofy and without the immersive factors that Mafia II had previously brought to the series.

Mafia II has been released in 2010 and it&#39;s still a good looking game even nowadays and also a fun game to play , I was expecting them to do the same with this title too  Mafia III is decent, but it could&#39;ve been better, I feel like they don&#39;t give that much attention to us, the pc gamers  The 30 FPS Cap shows it pretty clearly, they post on the community hub and say that they are working to fix the issue and we should expect soon to be able to play in 60 FPS, is this a joke, in 2016 you release a game like this with 30 FPS Cap and also blurry textures ported from console ?   Pretty disappointing

I want to love this game so much. It has everything required to make a good game, a interesting backstory and time, originallity and a good dev team but it falls short on every aspect but originality. The concept and story is great in theory but it does not live up to expectations in any sense of the word. The driving is too powerful, the combat is sloppy, the sneaking is just awful in general but the worst is the AI. The AI is so bad and this ruins the game. Im ashamed for it to be a mafia game As I enjoyed the previous mafia games. I do not reccomend.

Controller setting go off  Okay, great, now we have 60 FPS but it doesn&#39;t really help to make game any good - it still crashes every here and there, controller mapping disappear, AI is dumb as hell, your character can get stuck near knee high obstavles, cars drive awkwardly and graphics quality is way worse than Mafia 2. This game surely gets &#39;Dissapointment of the Year&#39; prize.

I pre-order this game and im disappointed with everything expect story. First what im going to do is cancel all pre-orders BF1, Dishonored 2, For the Honor etc... Im not gonna pre order anything. You will enjoy story for sure but gameplay, textures, low fps and other stuff you will say why the hell i bought this crap. Im not gonna lie and say i didnt enjoy even with those problems but recommend this game to someone NO WAY! I was so mad on first day of release because of 30 fps lock.  People dont pre order games because developers rush their games and make them unplayable  . They also patch 30fps and put unlimited fps but even after that game stutter and lag. Wont even talk about bugs (flying cop cars etc..). They develop this game for 6 years and what they did nothing. Mafia 2 is better in all aspects. Im so sad that Hangar13 ruined mafia series like that. I regret pre-ordering this game and buying on steam store for full price. People if you are here for the story buy the game but its gonna be frustrating play this game on 49 fps not even :S. Wait for sale or buy cheap on other site.   For those still looking how bad mafia 3 is look at this video    Mafia 2 vs Mafia 3   Thanks for reading!

Maybe 30 FPS locked....But I really don&#39;t see much I could Down vote on the game little into the story it&#39;s very rich and gripping, gameplay feels smooth and great stealth driving isn&#39;t too bad gets a tad annoying when on simulated ( spin out a lot )   The soundtrack is great very good classics adds to the picture and with cutscenes they play perfect tracks to fit the current situation  Mafia 2 was very linear with things you could do it was purely follow a path and that was it no side stuff I feel this one is already much more free and open it doesn&#39;t feel you&#39;re tied down to anything as such other than planning revenge   Gunplay is very smooth but you also do have the option for pure stealth what I do enjoy cause it opens up options to how you want to play not always guns blazing  Graphics also are fine I don&#39;t feel they are lacking in any way.  The fans of previous mafias will not be disappointed with the game itself has a great Mob feel to it doesn&#39;t feel too generic and feels like the story has some great twists to it  My overall rating of the game is 9/10   *Again this is just my review of the game I know a lot of the reviews are receiving hate...we all have free speech this is my view on the game hope many more people will get to enjoy it.*  if you are going with the rest of the reviews it may discourage you from buying it... They will be patching the &#39;30 fps&#39; I think once that&#39;s patched may see more positives come from it shaky release but I feel 2K will come back.

+ Story  + Music + Shooting &amp;amp; AI damage hitpoints + Ambience  + Sounds are nice except for car sounds. Voice-acting is very good. The car sounds itself aren&#39;t that great and also won&#39;t adjust to surroundings (including the car horn). I have the feeling they didn&#39;t have time to implement this. They did have time to add an effect when you ride into a big garage underground and the radio signal gets messy.    -  30 fps lock on release  (removed with patch) - poorly optimized for pc - game crashes  - Low texture quality - Sometimes texture pop-ins - Weather skybox - Launcher settings not applied in-game - Broken key-rebinding. Latest patch solved a few things, but still broken.  - Enemy AI sometimes spots you through buildings - Gameplay gets repetitive  - Cars damage model - Fighting compared to previous Mafia is simplistic   Save your money. Also comparing to Mafia 2 a lot of smaller things are missing like particle physics, world interaction (police bribing, kicking doors, eating hotdogs, ..)

---MAFIA III Review--- Okay folks I was very hyped for this game, honestly who wouldn&#39;t be? An open world, crime, sequel of Mafia II set in New Orleans, with freedom to approach any mission the way you please, sounds great right? What we got was horrible optimization, hardly any freedom in terms to activities, and just pure utter disappointment. The story is actually pretty good, but the way the missions are executed is horrible. You do the same thing each time, Interrogate a dude, kill some guys, break some things, then kill the boss. Rinse wash repeat. It&#39;s horrible, but the one thing I&#39;m utterly disappointed in is the lack of activities in the game. In Mafia II, speeding was considered a ticktable offense and you could actually get tickets. Now they just throw themselves at you and try to gun you down. You can&#39;t even sit down at the diner and enjoy some good ole&#39; southern Boudain, you can merely rob it for it&#39;s petty cash. This game was rushed out, and poorly executed. I do not recommend this game for the price of $60...

The game itself is great. The storyline is awesome, the cut scenes are really detailed and well polished BUT and I mean this is a big but, this game isn&#39;t ready. Like everyone else, the 30FPS lock is extremely frustrating. It took me a while to get used to it enough so I could play it. Also, i&#39;ve noticed randomly the game will freeze for a few seconds, then resume, then freeze again when I am entering a new area. (This isn&#39;t a hardware issue I run all other games just fine). A lot of people are saying stop being so hard on the devs for the issues but I disagree. These are easy fixes that should have been seen way before launch day. If you haven&#39;t bought the game yet, I would wait until the the patch comes out to fix these issues.

I loved Mafia 1 and 2 and I was excited to buy Mafia 3. But I was Disappointed when I played it. It felt like Mafia 3 took a big step backward&#39;s. It felt like 2k games didn&#39;t play Mafia 1 or 2. You can not do anything in the environment. The thing I loved the most in Mafia 2 is the Interaction with the world around you. In Mafia 3 the world around you is dull and boring. The people just walk and weight and in Mafia 2 the NPC walked, talked to you and other people, they look at stuff and waved they even read newspapers. you can open the hood and trunk of your car but you cant do that in Mafia 3. And the police are so @#&amp;amp;! frustrating in Mafia 3 but in Mafia 2 the police arent to bad and you can bribe the police. The only thing I liked about Mafia 3 is the story and songs. This is just my opinion.

This is the worst Mafia title to date. First problem 30fps lock for PC. Second problem, bad console port considering Mafia was always a PC title when it first came around back in the days. Third problem, there&#39;s no customization what so ever, you can&#39;t go into any stores to buy clothes or anything, the only purpose the stores have is to rob the cash register and there&#39;s hardly any around. Fourth problem, there&#39;s no longer any gas in vehicles, which was always a thing in Mafia games, so gas stations have no purpose what so ever. Fifth problem, regular crashes from time to time which makes it unbearable to play. Sixth problem, there&#39;s CONSTANT pop-up windows trying to explain ♥♥♥♥ to you over six hours into the game. For ♥♥♥♥ sake 2k, what the hell did you idiots take making this game? Seventh problem, they&#39;re reusing waaaaay to many assets for missions and side-missions. What a joke and the list goes on.  One positive thing I found in this title was the radio messup when driving through tunnels, that was a really nice touch.  I&#39;d recommend Mafia I or II, but III not going to happen. Wait for patches and mods to come out before playing this title unless you want cancer. 2.0/10.  &#39;I never asked for this.&#39; - Adam Jensen.

EDIT: The patch has landed and with it there is some good news and bad news, perfomance is everywhere, if you get 60, be glad, some people even with gtx1080 can&#39;t reach 60, it&#39;s still early though, i myself can&#39;t get the option to work and i will have to do a fresh install i think, but i will do that later, ui scale has not been fixed yet so it is still rather bad for my screen sadly.  It&#39;s still early for the game and they have promished more patches, it is a good start, but the game is still not in a good shape of what you can expect from a pc game.  Wait for a sale if you want the story, and if you use a widescreen monitor (aspect ratio 21:9) be sure to check that the ui scale has been fixed, else you will have a really bad experience with it.  TDLDR; Bugs a plenty, fps is fixed (mostly) performance is all over the place and with a screen that goes above 1080p be sure to check for bugs on the net on forehand, i can not recommend the game right now.  The story however should be excellent, sound fantastic and gameplay good, but for me the game has too many issues regarding my system (ui scale, turning my keyboard light off and oddly enough options not saving so i can&#39;t use the new 60fps/unlimited, will try a fresh install later, but for now the new options aren&#39;t working even when changed manually in the configs).  Edit: As it seems people do not understand what i mean by UI scale, if you play at 1080p it is most likely fine, but at 1440p, oh boy the game will most likely be unplayable   http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/438364144686443853/B5390B400B7C541B203BAC2D6D5BE88DD048A798/   You can check my other screens of the game as they are from the same screen and how they look at various resolutions, the aspect ratio is 16:9 and the screen I&#39;m using is a pg279q rog swift.

I really wish I didn&#39;t buy this game..I played both Mafia &amp;amp; Mafia 2 and loved them both. I was so excited for this one that I actually pre-ordered it, something I rarely do. Came home from work on the day it released and played it for probably 6 hours straight. I have to admit, the storyline and cutscenes had me gripped at first, but it was quickly overshadowed by the horrible performance issues and constant crashes. I soon realized that the game is extremely repetitive, something I didn&#39;t expect at all. It&#39;s literally the same type of missions over and over and OVER..what were they thinking..!?  Now, several weeks later, I don&#39;t even play it anymore. Even after the &#39;performance updates&#39;, the game runs pretty much just like before; like ♥♥♥♥. I even went out and upgraded my GTX 960 to a GTX 1060 6GB...almost zero boost in performance (at least none worth mentioning). I get pretty much the exact same FPS as before, even though all my other games run amazing now. From what I&#39;ve been reading, even people with 1080s and i7s struggle to get 50-60 FPS, which is just pathetic!! So many bugs and glitches in the game that it really takes you out of the zone and reminds you that you&#39;re playing a video game...a crappy one at that. No joke, I have played early access games that were more prepared for release than this garbage - it&#39;s a slap to face! It&#39;s completely disrepectful, something EA would do!!  I&#39;m not even mad...I&#39;m terribly upset and disappointed. I have waited several years for this game to come out and it was a total failure in my book, or at least the PC release. If you ask me, 2k should be working their asses off to get this game running perfectly and from what I see, they&#39;ve shown almost no remorse and have done very little to fix their screw-up of a game. They released this game entirely too early and they know it. It&#39;s so horribly optimized that it&#39;s laughable and if I even thought for a second that Steam would give me a refund, I&#39;d be fighting like hell for it.  Total waste of money and I will think twice before buying Mafia IV, or any 2K or Hanger 13 game for that matter.  AND BY THE WAY - After reading these positive reviews, I&#39;m convinced the majority of people are either paid to write positive reviews, or they have some type of affiliation with the creators. There&#39;s no freaking way someone could think so highly of this, much less ever recommend it to their friends. They aren&#39;t very good friends if so.

This review is into the technical aspect of things; I might update it when I am getting a bit more into the actual gameplay.   However, the first look at this game cries &#39;lazy port from console&#39; out of every of its voids:  - 30 fps lock and graphics look like rendered from an internally low resolution badly upscaled to the actual screen resolution - in fact, lower graphic settings can give a clearer pictures. For example, the higher the antialias settings, the more the picture is smeared onto the screen. Yes, less jaggies around the edges, but not in a good sense, because less detail overall. To make it even more tedious, every game restart revertes antialias back to high - though you can choose lots of screen resolutions, not all of them play out properly. For example, 1920x1080 resolution will have text messages on the screen that overlap each other in an akward and sometimes unreadable way - There is a menu to rebind controls, however a) not all keys that work in most PC games as bind are possible and b) even if you can rebind a control doesn&#39;t mean it will work ingame (for example, binding movement controls to mousebuttons are accepted in the binding screen, but simply won&#39;t work later)  I know the devs are saying they have a PC patch in the making. However, from what I have seen so far, I don&#39;t expect too much. So far, it looks like the game is ported from consoles (and their quality definitions, meaning peasant hardware) via an emulator, and system requirements have been defined by: - Minimum: Anything that can run the game - Recommended: Anything that is able to reach the 30 fps lock  So, my expectation for the patch is what I experienced with Evil Within: PC Patch for uncapping fps, leading to max. 40 fps given the recommended hardware instead of 30 fps locked. And we don&#39;t know if the game will run into problems later when there is more than 30 fps, because what I have seen so far from (obviously not!) testing different settings (see the text overlap problem at 1920x1080 resolution and the control binding problems) says &#39;give the pc guys some options so we can say we did, who the hell cares if they work properly&#39;.  Maybe they should have taken the GTA V approach and take a year to make it an acceptable port to PC.  So to summarize: In its current state, I cannot recommend the game given its AAA price while its subpar technical quality. Not broken, but there is definetly some room for improvement.  UPDATE / Addition after the Patch 1.01 on 9th of october:  Framerate not locked to 30 fps anymore. However, quite exactly what I expected: It is running at 40 fps now. Well, when fiddling with the settings it gets the fps into the playable 50ies (floating between 40 and 80 depending on the rendered scene).  Also quite expected about the rest of the patch: Though they said they worked on the control bindings, what I would like to have as control layout STILL DOESN&#39;T WORK. Concerning the antialias setting not saving: I had to redo it once, however, another time it was saved correctly between games. Lets see how that works out in the long run.  So, there is improvement, at least I am getting not so sick from playing anymore, however there is still a long way to go. This patch made the game from a no-no to rather no.  Addition 10th october:  After playing a bit longer, I got to say that i am not impressed. Other bugs, annoyances and general cheap and lazy programming / design attitude are just the icing on the unsharp low fps graphics: - uneven loudness of character voices in one and the same dialogue  - drove the car into water -&amp;gt; instant death - characters doing idle / bored animation while talking a sad story about their past   The story can&#39;t make up for all that shortcomings, lazyness, and sheet.  Unfortunately, it&#39;s too late for a refund now. Thanks to all the defenders of bad games who say you can&#39;t judge if you haven&#39;t play long enough. My initial impression didn&#39;t change. So, lets just eat this subpar thing because we paid for it, and get even more cautios when preordering next time.  So my final suggestion is: Buy it when its price tag falls below 20 bucks. Because it is a poor man&#39;s gta v. But still needs a very beefy graphics card. I get two times the fps in gta v compared to this ♥♥♥♥ here.  Update 25th november: Game still sucks. I just nominated if for the “Putting an end to a great franchise by totally ♥♥♥♥ing up the latest installment” Award

As a punitive action for this developer releasing the game in a state contrary to previous representation I am submitting a permanent negative review. Developers have a responsibility to stop doing this. I will not change this review. Redistributable files such as directx and c++ should install automatically before startup. Graphics options should be greater or equal to console equivalint, not less. I had to sit through 5 minutes of game crashes to be authorized to leave this review.

Mafia III review from someone who played 1st and 2nd many times  I won&#39;t beat around the bush, 3rd part was a complete disaster from my point of view. No feeling of Mafia at all, some guy from the hood wants a revenge and goes berserk. I managed to pass the game regardless of pain and agony in my heart thinking how they managed to name this game after Mafia franchise...  Some pointers in general  Negative: - Main character goes whole game with no suit on (&#39;very mafia like...&#39;) - No public transport throughout the city (there are rails, but nothing ever goes on them...) - City in general looks vague and empty (expected more from game this size) - Mafia 1 AI was better than here (it tells alot, and no, it&#39;s not a joke) - Don&#39;t look into the sky - Car handling reminds Need for Speed - 0 challenge - Cops... what cops... - Because of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ police there is no speed limiter for your vehicle anymore too..  - About 90% of the game you will be doing one and same thing in same places - Very little dialogues or any kind of input through out the game (like some capo speaking next to you while you drive to places), makes whole story look bad with missing pieces - They managed to put VITO in some district manager&#39;s place... what can i say...  Positive: - Cinematic and lip sync was great, really great - I won&#39;t need to pass this game again  Creators took everything great from this game and added Assassin&#39;s creed and GTA elements. Do not buy this game, at least not for price it goes now.

Pros: - Interesting main characters and story. - Awesome soundtrack Cons: - Mandatory sandbox to progress. Boring routine. To play each story mission player should grind for 2 hours. - Mediocre story missions.  - No characters development in missions. - Not consistent and sometimes awful graphics. - Strange control scheme. Why scope is on another button that aiming down sights? - Cowardly consumer-unfriendly marketing with embargo on reviews before release.  5/10. Mediocre and boring game.

Update 10/8: The framerate has been officially unlocked and I&#39;m getting 75-90 fps. The game is smooth as butter now.  I want to address the &#39;Elephant in the Room&#39; and admit the faults of the PC version. It has a 30 fps cap, and it suffers from similar issues as Quantum Break with blurry textures that appear upscaled. I have a decent pc with a GTX 1080 and a 1440p 144hz monitor. I was angry about the fps cap, but they are clearly working on a fix at the moment and I&#39;d rather focus on the game itself, which ultimately will be what remains.  So far, the game has tremendous atmosphere. The story, which is traditionally a hallmark of the Mafia series, is on point. It will be subjective, but it hits close to home since I&#39;m a veteran. I truly understand the difficulties adjusting when you get back home and falling back into the bad crowd. This goes beyond that, but we all have protagonists we gravitate toward whether they are right or wrong.  The story is gripping, and the style is cinematic. This is not a 30fps joke, but I really like the flashbacks and the attempt at character development. The racism is front and center, but it&#39;s accurate as a period piece. We live in a time where people are triggered by everything, so I commend the developers for showcasing the less dignified times of our history. I have family that still acts this way, and this really shows how deeply it is rooted in their minds based on their upbringing.  The music and sound are quite good, with many notable tracks. The radio stations in the car are littered with talk and advertisements. I always found this interesting in other open world driving type games.  Conclusion: The graphics in particular need some PC love. The models are quite good but the world is a bit lacking in places. This might just be an &#39;open world&#39; side-effect that won&#39;t be changed. I&#39;m willing to accept it because the gameplay is good. The animations are exceptional. The lipsync is perfect in cutscenes and the combat animations are nuanced and fluid. This was unexpected, because I expected things to be a bit janky. Outside of the 30fps lock and the inconsistent textures, I&#39;ve experienced some lighting issues while driving. It&#39;s not a deal breaker but it&#39;s worth mentioning. I wanted to write a review earlier than I would normally, because most have been negative. I completely agree with anyone being mad about the fps lock, but this isn&#39;t Arkham Knight. I&#39;ve had no crashes and it runs at a consistent framerate. That being said, I&#39;m looking forward to the patch that fixes some of these issues.

  Repetetive quests and lack of variations in cars in traffic, weapons and quests. Mainquests are almost like the sidequests.  You do not feel that you have made a difference or that you have come forward after some quests.  Feels like the game are 50% done. Like the deadline were too close and they just had to give us SOMETHING at the realase day...  Otherwise, it&#39;s good graphics and a good open world. But that doesn&#39;t compensate the cons at all. For me it is a uninstall after just 8.3 hours of gaming...  Had high hopes on this game after Mafia: 2.

GTA V in Ultra Settings, Doom in Ultra settings all at 60fps (you get the picture) this isn&#39;t going over 42fps at the best of times. Not to mention so many graphical glitches and low res textures popping up. Never mind the repetitive missions, the only thing that is keeping me going is the interesting storyline (And most of that happens in pre-rendered cutscenes and shows you what the game could look like if they actually bothered).

It was a big disappointment, for some people, it&#39;s entertaining for sure, you feel superior and strong, but it is a disaster compared to mafia 2, i don&#39;t even know where to start. 1. The vehicle physics are unbelieveable, it&#39;s a absoulte joke, in Mafia 2, you feels like you&#39;re really driving a heavy, solid car. 2. The NPC have no character, when you stroll around the streets in mafia 2, you walk at a normal speed, different people have different postures, different reactions, everything tells a story, but in mafia 3, every civilain are the same in a way. 3. The objects around Lincoln. I walked into cassandra&#39;s home, accidently knocked over a bunch of stools, they fell and break into pieces and then disappear, Okay. 4. You just keep playing, there is not much to tell, repeat repeat repeat, at the start, it&#39;s compelling, then mid-way though, you just feel like Marcano and his goons are bunch of weak studds, no one will travel with you, talk with you except for Donovan, the whole story is just lost it attractiveness, the Father James thing was also a nice touch but then it&#39;s also just not interesting to play anymore. 5. Hand to Hand Combat or takedowns, way to eaisy, some are good, most of it aren&#39;t, it makes the enimes too weak, the enimies also have no personality presence whatsoever, they are all the same, they all lack any self-preservation, stupid af, and weak, their reaction to bullet hits are also disappointing, makes you feel good but I&#39;m not impressed with it at all like when you punch a gu in the face, he fainted, like they are acting poorly to pretend they are knocked out by lincoln. 6. Things you can do, no eating , no sleeping, no changing, no nothing, and no replaying levels, either lives and the town that you rule or start a new game, the ending was not powerful by all means, you felt like that&#39;s it, okay, goodbye. 7. Bullets hits, try shooting a car and then&#39;ll know, the glass physics is ♥♥♥♥ poor, there are also no solid bullet holes, when you shoot a enemy, the guns acts like a health reductor instead of a gun, the sounds are not good the reactions of enemies are also bad. 8. Finished the game in the diffculty set to hard, still not hard and i didn&#39;t even used backups, cutting phone lines, bribing cops and weapon van, not even once. 9. the building an empire thing just dont fit well with a mafia story, it&#39;s like the underworld or criminal sim city. 10. the scene shown in the launch trailer felt nothing like the game. 11. the lsit could go on and on

I loved Mafia II so I was expecting something good here. But this game does not hold up to the old game, not at all. I find myself doing the same stuff over and over and over again, it quikly gets boring! Now, it&#39;s not that this game is such a bad game, it&#39;s not! But if you compare it to Mafia II it&#39;s not that good. If you have not played the second game I would recommend this game, but if you&#39;ve played the second I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s worth it. Kind of ruined the whole Mafia name for me.   There&#39;s not much detail in the game and it repeats it self too much. The graphics are nice but it doesn&#39;t matter if the game&#39;s not that good.   It was hard giving this game a thumbs down because Mafia means so much for me, but I&#39;m hoping the dev. team can learn from this mistake.

Well the game overall has huge potential but its held back by MAJOR FLAWS -HORRIBLE textures, absolute garbage,so many examples but go look at the water....it will make you cringe -HORRIBLE controller support, wont even show what buttons do what in controller layout, just shows nothing...been guessing the entire time as i dont want to play this game with k&amp;amp;m, cant even figure out how to whistle or throw grenades. -bad 21:9 support if any, start menu is unnavigatable in 3440x1440, in game is fine for some reason after switching from 2560x1440 -30fps cap (if not fixed) -overall looks muddy like there is extreme TAA on at all times even with low AA -no button to stop sticking to cover  THE GOOD -characters are great and have alot of depth so far -Story is also really good so far (as it should be being a linear game) -DRIVING SIMULATION...thank you for that, it feels great to have different surfaces impact drifting/stopping to varying degrees -shooting supprsingly feels very good as well had alot of fun dumping a full clip of a thompson into Baka (only to have him take a knee and wait for a cut scene... really?) -lighting i feel is very good too, if only the AA and textures didnt suck so hard.  overall i feel the game isnt worth 60 dollars right now, they really need to fix the textures and AA or whatever makes this game look like im playing a cool game with vaseline slathered glasses on, because while the gameplay and story are very likeable right now, the graphics keep breaking the immersion (and so is the framerate, if you dont have Gsync, even if you do have it it would be 100% better at 60fps+)    EDIT: so the patch has just dropped and lets just say the decision to refund was almost instant lol, worst port ever. the game was capped at 30fps because theres no way in hell ur gonna run this at 60+fps unless ur at 1080p. couldnt get more than 50fps (this wasnt a constant 50 either, more,like average 45) when absolutley nothing was going on around me in a decently empty area in the game (keep in mind i run witcher 3 anywhere from 50 on very rare occasions all the way up to 90 fps on ultra without AA or hairworks on 3440x1440p). Its a real shame too as the story actualy did have me wanting to play more but i just cant do it, its no many sky performance all over again. :(

I really wanted to love Mafia 3, but Mafia 3 has been a huge let down. The game is simply abysmal. I&#39;ve refunded and no matter how much they patch it, the first playthrough will be etched on my mind. This game could have been utterly superb but they botched it. Not only that, they misrepresented the quality too which is awful business practise. This game is not worthy to be in anyones Steam library. It should be tied up and dumped into the nearest river, I&#39;m sure even Lincoln Clay would want that.

Pre-refund review, please take with a grain of salt.  Graphics-wise, it feels completely unfinished.  - Lots of blurriness or flat out ugly textures (even at 4600x1600 res). - Recurring visual glitches, such as a massive shadow on the ground approaching you when switching from overcast to clear day (and it swung back and forth between the two 4-5 times). - Car parked in garage before a cutscene got fused into the ground, turning it into scrap metal. - Sunlight bloom (or, well, not proper bloom, just a huge bright spot) clips through all objects, literally couldn&#39;t see the road in front of me because of it despite that it cut through a wall and a tree. - Graphics options are lacking, cant even turn off AA.  Gameplay-wise, your painfully average console game mechanics all the way.  - AI is typical, either stands and just shoots or runs to cover and peeks out to easily be killed, nothing worth mentioning. - Difficulty level doesn&#39;t mean much, since you&#39;re never pushed up on by the AI it&#39;s just a matter of hiding and waiting for the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ health regen. - One-button takedowns all the way, because apparently it&#39;s all about showing off animations rather than trying. - Melee is pretty much just running up and spamming one button. - Stealth is about as unimaginative as usual. Sneak up, takedown. Sneak up, whistle, takedown. Yawn. - Good point is that the enemies at least don&#39;t take 30 bullets each to kill. So at hard difficulty you can at least pretend that it&#39;s somewhat realistic. - Driving physics are fairly good at simulation mode. Crashing still seems to have no effect, with the other car often being pushed aside while you keep on driving like nothing happened. - Cops are surprisingly effective, they managed to pop two tyres and ram me into a river, nice stuff. Stopped chasing the moment I started swimming though, so meh.  None of this touches on the storyline, which I reckon is the game&#39;s strong point, because with max 2 hours I wanted to test as much as possible before &#39;playing for real&#39; the next time around. However, there seems to be extremely few moral choices, so it appears that we&#39;re just along for the ride.

Save your money and don&#39;t buy this.  The game repeats the same pattern over and over again. Kill, interrogate, destroy, steal. In some places when you have cleared a place from enemies, 10 minutes later you have to do it again, as a boss guy has appeared there.   Npc AI is weird. People can&#39;t drive at all! Ordered a shiny new car and some ammo at my location, only to find that the driver for the new car drives straight into a pole, and the ammo van crashes his car to mine a few seconds later!  I found it ridiculous when the main character was soaked in gasoline, only to light the lighter himself just a moment afterwards to light up the enemy who was also soaked in gasoline by the player. Like that wouldn&#39;t have ignited the main character as well.  The skybox is the ugliest thing I&#39;ve seen in a while. And I&#39;ve seen a lot of things.  Soundtrack is awesome. Voice acting is great.   I only remember a couple of fun and interesting moments in the game. That&#39;s it.

So far, lm enjoying the game. The animations, gunplay and music are on point, and the story is being told in a very interesting and enganging way.  However, due to performace issues, l simply cant reccomend this. Even with the patch, I can&#39;t get more than 50 FPS,even if l turn all settings to low, with a PC that has better specs than the ones reccomended by the developer.  Also, wtf&#39;s up with the new wanted system? It&#39;s ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. If a witness calls the cops saying some random car was stolen, the cops will not only immeditaely now it was you even without having your description or licencse plate, but will continue to pursue you if by the time they arrived you&#39;re on a different car, and they&#39;ll shoot to kill.Just for stealing a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ car. This is a major downgrade from Mafia 2&#39;s wanted system (which in my opinion is the best in any game). You can&#39;t even picklock cars anymore.  Also, on the subject of cars, is it just me or they never ♥♥♥♥ing break? I need to crash several times at high speed just to see a dent in a car ffs.  Lastly, the missions so far, save for the first few ones, have been really repetitive. Go to an enemy truf, kill them, then either kill a VIP, steal some ♥♥♥♥, or destroy ♥♥♥♥. Over and ♥♥♥♥ing over again.   To sum it up, Mafia 2 is a better game overall.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixlszwKVVP0           Also, the mirrors in this game... they&#39;re a ♥♥♥♥ing joke. The fact that mafia 3 is sooooo much worse than mafia 2 is already ♥♥♥♥ed up. But the fact that literally Duke Nukem has better mirrors than Maifa 3?????

Whith this game i was expecting a colorful story driven and rich quest much like Mafia 2, not true here you have a rinse and repeat game play. however although the textures are better the driving physics are spongy at best, the cars don&#39;t damage as they should. The gunplay is poorly optimised and makes Clay an unrealistic one man army. The best way to sum up this game is to say that it has the graphics of a GTA game and the game play of Saints row.

The game has flickering bars on 3440x1440 which for a &#39;next gen&#39; game should NOT BE!  The Bloodsplatter Overlay is set to 16:9 and stays like that even if you play on 21:9... which is REALLY ANNOYING. Dont forget the 30fps cap which never got revealed until the last day before release...   So a BIG MINUS. Overhyped trash like No Mans Sky

I am a huge fan of the mafia series. Been playing since xbox (mafia 1). I don&#39;t recommend this game because my system is well beyond the recommendation, yet I cannot get it to run at 60 fps unless I lower the settings to 720p. Even like that, it still drops framerate to below 45fps sometimes and the screen makes all the letters and everything so big that it covers the screen. With my system, I should be able to run the game at 4k 60fps like my other games. I think this game has some problem with nvidia and just generally does not work well. I bought it becuz I love the series, but I would suggest waiting until after they fix all bugs and the game starts running well on pc at 60 fps with max settings. Just play mafia 2 for now. That runs perfect.

After Mafia II, this is a disgrace. Batman 2.0 is what you get here. I am someone that can tell a difference between 60hz and 144hz. 30FPS locked is unplayable for me. I play at 4K resolution and this game does not even support UI scaling. Everything requires me to lean forward to be able to read. The AI is god awful and stupid. They stand right in front for you to shoot them. After playing shooters like The Division, the gun gameplay in Mafia 3 feels stiff and clunky.   I never ever pre-order games and I regret I did for this one. Mistake made, lesson learned. At least I didn&#39;t pay full price for this POS port. Wait for a super patch if ur on the fence. But I will say the VO and the storytelling so far are top-notch.

A warning to those who are thinking about buying the game. I would hold that thought for a few more days - you probably aren&#39;t going to be playing it anyway.  I really don&#39;t have a problem with the graphics. Heck, I think the game looks pretty good (so far). My problem is with how it plays... Or rather, how it doesn&#39;t play.  You can&#39;t remap keys. If you do, it apparently &#39;disables&#39; that key permanently. At least that&#39;s what it did for me. - I remapped the &#39;Stalk&#39; (crouch/sneak) key. Before the remap it was working. Now it isn&#39;t - and it doesn&#39;t work if I change it back either. This means I am unable to sneak, a pretty important thing really...  In addition the game keeps crashing/freezing - often, but not always, during a cutscene. When I load the game up again I am on to the next mission. This effectively means I lost part of the story. In one instance I didn&#39;t really know why I was on a mission... The story behind the mission was basically &#39;skipped&#39; because the game had crashed.  To summerise.:  The game is broken -- unplayable for most people. Don&#39;t buy it until they fix it. A shame really, cause it looks so good.

I am sick of watching game trailers and being wowed only to be given a lemon when it comes out.   spend thousands on a high end PC so people on console can enjoy a smooth 30fps  Do i refund now and maybe buy it again if they fix it? or hold it in wait for a patch to give us a game that is represented in the trailers and screenshots of the game?, and not get a refund as we held it too long.....  Chances are most people buying it on PC have a Pretty decent gaming rig for todays standards and yet this shows how much they know / care / listen to gamers on PC. Like the corporate world we ♥♥♥♥ing have to live in now, they care more about sales to consoles than delivering a game that is complete, tested and what people want.  i cant bare to play this game on my 4k monitor and 4k rig its like i need glasses or there is something in my eyes its got this annoying cheap blur to it, and like No mans Sky if you dont make it at least 60FPS and i see it crisp up, ill be getting a refund regardles of the gameplay, just looks so cheap.

How do you take such a great game franchise and ♥♥♥♥ it up.Its easy, just take everything great about Mafia 2 and make sure you don&#39;t put it in Mafia 3.Oh yea, Make sure you release the game with crippled frame rates, Because you know PC gamers will love that.Not to mention game crashes,Lost game saves.  If all the cut scenes were done with the game engine.I have to ask,What game engine were you using,Because its sure as hell was not the one that I got.  Last but not least make absolutely sure the game is painfully repetitive.  Steam would not give a refund since it showed 4 hours of game play.

Locking the framerate is bad enough, locking it as low as 30 FPS is even worse, but the move that ensures I&#39;ll never again pre-order a 2k game again was the fact that they refused to hand out advance copies to reviewers.  This shows a clear awareness that this was a serious problem that would affect pre-orders and sales in general, but rather than informing us about it before release, they did their best to conceal it and keep racking up pre-orders.  Acknowledging the problem and promising a fix is a good start, but the lack of an admission that they intentionally hid this, not to mention the lack of an apology, makes things crystal clear. This is an attempt to minimise refunds and salvage future sales, not an admission that they behaved poorly, or that they will learn a lesson and do better in the future.  This kind of unrepentant deceptive behaviour is unacceptable, and I for one will think long and hard before ever buying another 2k game, and definitely won&#39;t pre-order one again.

The level of detail and small extra features from mafia 2 are gone. The best thing about this game is probably the soundtrack.

EDIT: This is not a complete review, as it focuses only on graphics. for me, for pc gaming, that is a prerequesite, that, if not met, does not require any further gameplay review, as I wouldnt play it. Good graphics and tweaking abilities are a prerequisite for a AAA Gaming experience imho.  --------  So, does NO ONE care that the resolution is upscaled?  That is not glitchy graphics, that is less resolution than advertised and less as seen in the 2015 gameplay vid. Again, like in Witcher 3.  That results in blurry graphics so that even a bit further away nothing appears really sharp, rather broken down in lines, blurs and undistinguishable shapes. (no fps issues for me i7-4770K, 16GB R, 970) This bluriness becomes most obvious with moving objects, like cars.  My native resolution would be 1920x1080.   Again, the RESOLUTION IS ONLY UPSCALED FROM 720p.  And that is why I cannot recommend to buy the game, because for me that is so off, so insulting as a PC Gamer that I cannot and cannot go past the first few turns in the first mission.  So, in all honesty, this isn&#39;t only an offer you cannot refuse, this is an offer you should definately refuse until they fix the resolution, graphics, fps and principal ♥♥♥♥♥♥ porting.  Salut, madonna, what a disgrace! (If the boss only knew...)

The game is locked at 30 FPS, which makes it UNPLAYABLE. It gave me a headache. The graphics look like crap. It renders at a lower resolution, looks like 720p upscaled. The textures terrible, very low quality. I get a lot of tearing. It lacks so many Options. Mafia 2 probably looks better in general. It sure not worth playing at this stage, nor does it worth the $60  I like the soundrack. I can&#39;t talk about the gameplay and the story since I can&#39;t play the game like this, it hurts my eyes.  The developer announced an patch coming this weekend to Fix the fps cap and some issues, I hope the game becomes playable after this. Also this game was developed by Hangar 13, and it&#39;s their FIRST game ever, I hope that they did not just fail.  I will change this review if the game gets fixed.  Update 10 Oct. 1st Patch: They removed the FPS cap and they fixed the &#39;blur&#39;a bit. That&#39;s not enough, the graphics still look like shιt, these textures come from 2006, and the optimization is horrible (~30fps with GTX1060 at 1440p) and the is a truckload of bags, everywhere. It also crashes all the time. Also some of the game mechanism are garbage. You push a person and they instantly die. you hit someone, they instantly die. WTF?  This game was far away by READY when they released it. And they have no excuse since it was 4 years in development. They FAILED.  Edit 2: After playing a couple more hours, all I gotta say is that this game is so poor and bad made that can&#39;t be fixed.  Edit 3 (12 Nov 2016): After another update (5.8GB) the performance was improved just a little, the graphics are still garbage and the game is still the same garbage.  I doubt this will ever be fixed.

  UPDATE SINCE THE ORIGINAL REVIEW... 30FPS Cap has been taken off, the game is a joy to play in 60 fps, I can only show respect those guys for listening to the consumers and reacting so fast with a 1.2GB patch, as well as the fps they apparently made some improvements, hopefully made some fixes about the blur that randomly appears on the screen, and the frame drops in certain areas... any other comments in the original review still remain my opinion except my comments on the 30 fps nonsense which obviously has been resolved)   The game has great potential, story starts off extremely strong and the story telling is very effective, gunplay and close combat feels personal and extremely satisfying, making you feel like a complete badass. Voice acting and lip sinking are absolutely top quality, HOWEVERRRRRRR.... I do not know who was in charge of the PC port, but they shall be forbidden from creating any video game content.... 30FPS Lock in 2016? To whistle at guards you have to press the &#39;DELETE&#39; button? Who thought that was a good idea? Game randomly gets blury, and the contrast between colours can get real buggy during cutscenes or during fast driving...  My only criticism about the actual gameplay is the AI being more stupid than the Aliens in Colonial Marines...  The game itself in my opinion is pretty solid so far, a little bit repetetive but then again I have not played long enough into the story to find out if this is just a phase or if this is the core of the game, hopefully it is not, and there will be other type of missions, won&#39;t mention any mission types don&#39;t want to spoil anything.   At the moment as the game stands with this terribly awful PC port I&#39;d rate it a 5/10... If and when these problems will be resolved and it would work as intended, with a decent PC port which we should hopefully be getting through patches and updates in the near future, only then with the solid gameplay would I give it a decent 8/10. As I said this game has potential to be really good, too bad that the PC port degrades it soooo much. But then again folks, maybe if the story turns out to be a dissapointment too, this rate could change too... We&#39;ll have to wait and see if 2K manages to get the patches out as soon as possible so that we can enjoy and finish the story at a much more comfortable 60FPS, and then we can look at the whole picture

I believe that a patch is in order. Thirty frames per second in this day and age is really not acceptable anymore. I&#39;ll refrain from demanding a refund in a week time but if there&#39;s still no patch to fix some the performance issue, I won&#39;t wait a second longer. I mean, really? Expecting players to play a shooting game on 30FPS? Come on, guys. The grainy looking post-effect isn&#39;t something I&#39;m particularly fond of either.

So they fixed the issues that shouldn&#39;tve been issues to begin with and I have actualy gotten some time in. Unfortunately the game is medicore at best. As many have pointed out it is repetitive and the open world is lacking substance. There just isnt much to do aside from killing people and taking over rackets and then killing a boss. That is literally the whole experience with nothing to entertain you in between. Also, you can see through ♥♥♥♥ing walls. I dont use the feature but come on, is the gaming community that bad now that you are expected to have ESP hacks in the game at launch?  Anyways, I would get this game for no more than 20 bucks. The story is great, the voice acting is great, the idea and the world the game is set in are both great, but the gameplay just falls so short that I really don&#39;t want to keep playing even though I want to know what happens in the story.

Excellent first 2hrs. Utterly dull and repetitive beyond that. Weird lighting, A.I. misbehaviors and poor car handleing. Repetitive mission structure, no small minigames or things to do in the world other than just killing constantly. This game is like a AAA &#39;Hatred&#39; clone.   Shame, because that intro was just so good.

A MASSIVE DISAPPOINTMENT.  To make it easy to comprehend how terrible this game is lets compare it Mafia 2.  Story:  In Mafia 2 you play as Vito, a man who became an Italian refugee before World War 2. As a poor family you became mixed up with bad people from an Italian mafia and eventually arrested and send to fight in WW2 as a soldier and translator, and after getting back because of your situation you were forced to continue with the criminal activity.  In Mafia 3 you are a black guy whose friends were killed and now you must take revenge!!!!!!  In all seriousness the story in Mafia 3 is terrible, they make you feel nothing for the character and only after 6 hours I already forgot the name of the characters that where killed in the beginning. The actual story missions are also terrible, you just do the same thing over and over again in different places on the map with an occasional cut scene thrown in. This brings me in on to my next point  Game mechanics:  This is a complete joke. In Mafia 2 you could do anything from tuning your cars to buying clothes to eating a sandwich from your fridge. In Mafia 3 there is absolutely nothing. Literally the gameplay consists of killing a guy, destroying his supplies and eventually killing a boss in that district. That’s it! Nothing else, you can’t even change your clothing. It feels like the game is not finished, I can’t even describe how little there is to do in this game.  Graphics:  I don’t even know what to say in regards to this. So I will put it simply, Mafia 2 a game from 2010 is in fact graphically better than mafia 3 a 2016 game. In Mafia 2 there are working physics, better lighting, you can leave bullet holes in vehicles. And this is only a beginning. There are so many graphical issues with Mafia 3 I would spend all day just writing them down. But here are some one worst one&#39;s. It’s SUPER blurry, like I can’t even see the writing on the subtitles, sometimes the weather bugs out and all you see is shadows teleporting everywhere, sometimes the NPC&#39;s just disappear.  Controls:  Mafia 2 had decent controls. Mafia 3 is a console port so it’s terrible. If you have a controller I guess it would be fine, but for the love of god do not play this game with mouse a keyboard.  Conclusion:  Absolute waste of money, do not buy this &#39;game&#39;, it’s simply not finished. They removed features, downgraded graphics, made so many bugs I&#39;ve lost count.  The issue&#39;s I have mentioned above are just a tip of the iceberg there are so many problems with this game I could write a book on this.  2/10 I would rather pay a dominatrix £30 to spank me, than purchase this game.

 Things I HATE with Mafia III:
compound: -0.6633, neg: 0.526, neu: 0.474, pos: 0.0, 
Since everyone else is talking about the technical issues with the game, let me begin with the problems with the actual design of Mafia 3, the things that really be can&#39;t be fixed.  At my current point in the game, its just &#39;Go to this racket, kill all the people steal all the money, tail this guy steal the money, do this little objective after killing all the people and stealing all the money, and then kill/team up with the guy that runs the racket&#39; Did the developers not play Mafia 2? I&#39;ll give it to them, the intro was outstanding, and it really made me feel like this would live up to what Mafia 2 was like....but then it just became a generic open world game to me.  One thing that made Mafia 2 special was the &#39;pointless&#39; things you could do, like getting drunk, opening and closing the hood/trunk of a car, and even turning lights on and off... this game has none of those details.  As of writing this review there is no character customisation, I know this is being added later on, but surely this kind of thing should be in the game, considering most people will have finished and been done with this game buy the time its here.   There doesn&#39;t seem to be proper car customisation in this game other than a few upgrades you can just buy from a generic upgrades menu (this menu is really dull and doesn&#39;t really feel imerssive at all).. where has that gone? that added hours of extra gameplay for me in Mafia 2 (Remember the Milk Truck?)  Leading on from those last two points. In Mafia 2 if you commited a crime there were several things that could happen, you could be fined, arrested, or shot at with either pistols/shotguns, or if you were even more wanted, machine guns. As well as that feature, there was a system that made you a wanted criminal, the Police could recognise your outfit and the vehicle you were driving, another feature completely ignored in this game.  Going on about cars again, I never really feels like you own a car (I havent gotten to the point where you seem to get lincolns car back) because you can&#39;t seem to store cars anywhere, there doesn&#39;t seem to be a garage system like in Mafia 2, it just feels like I am jumping from car to car (if not just walking because I don&#39;t want to deal with the police, because its not really fun in this comapred to Mafia 2)  The sound design feels a bit off as well, when in a vehicle it doesn&#39;t sound like the exhaust sounds are coming from the car itself.  The rear view mirror is just awful, get rid of it. All it shows is a partly rendered world behind you (that even if you look behind and render the world is still not rendered properly) I definetly don&#39;t remember it looking that bad in the trailers (the cars headlights don&#39;t even light up, but the beams of light are there). If the rendering in the mirrror is that bad, it makes me think they just nerfed the hell of it to try and ease performance issues (which are bad enough now as it is).  One thing that really got me going about Mafia 3, was the music, but even that falls flat. I have only played for 7.6 hours at this point (and not much of that has been in cars) and I am only hearing a few songs (Mafia 2 didn&#39;t have the biggest variety of music, but it felt more fleshed out than this does).    I have probably missed somethings, but I guess I will move onto the technical stuff.  The graphics on the highest settings look bad in a lot of the environment (sometimes worse than Mafia 2), some aspects in regards to player and NPC models is really good, but the world is really lacking.   I am getting a pretty poor framerate (980ti, 16gb, i6700k) at near max settings (had to turn off some of the post processing stuff entirely to even be able to stay above 30 in some states), If I can walk through Boston in Fallout 4 at a pretty high setting, and pretty much stay at 60 most of the time, but not in this game? you&#39;ve got a problem.  The lighting is bugged to hell and just ruins the look of the game.  Its been fixed now, but F**k the 30fps limit.  I have so far only crashed once, but crashing once in 7 hours of play is still too much.   This technical stuff could have been easily fixed if they jsut delayed the game a bid, did they not listen to CD Projekt Red&#39;s reason for delaying The Witcher 3 again?    Overall, if you loved Mafia 2, and the style of game it was, this is most certainly NOT like it. The only real resemblence of Mafia 2 in this game is the name, and Vito being in it (and a few references here and there. The Story itself is interesting (I love the flashbacks and film clips), but the gameplay, and the world design let it down. If only the rest of the game was as interesting as the introduction, because the rest of it just feels rushed and done by an inexperienced team.  At the end of the day, if you were looking into this because you played previous itterations, I can&#39;t recomend this to you if you wanted a similar experience, I don&#39;t even think I can recommend it to someone who just wants to play and open world crime game... because its not even that good at that.   I am not even mad, just really dissapointed.   I just wish they got 2K Czech involved with the developement of this.

Personally i loved Mafia 2 but Mafia 3 really doesn&#39;t meet the mark it needs to.  Cons first:  1. Graphics for the most part don&#39;t look very good like sometimes the lighting is pretty off and it just has this wierd look for me that doesn&#39;t appeal to my eyes. Not everyone might agree but i just don&#39;t think it looks very good clouds don&#39;t look super good ethire. And if you wondering i play with everything maxed and 1080p, everything but ambient occlusion. 2. Cars are WAY to easy to drive like, drifting i found super easy and when turning it simulator it does make it harder, but it&#39;s still pretty easy. 3. Car Damage is terrible like slamming into things at 100km and the car has not a scratch while my hole front end should be ♥♥♥♥ed up, it&#39;s kinda silly smashing into a wall and literally nothing changing about your car yet i&#39;ve seen guys drive into sheds at lower speeds and there car spouts flames. 4. The sound system is really wierd, cars and cutscenes have great sounds but yet whens it raining i can&#39;t even here it like i should here the pitter patter of the rain on my car and roof tops, it really does add a personal feel of Immersion. Also guns while they sound alright don&#39;t sound to great and are pretty average. 5. Theres some glitches that happen now and then but there not to open but one big problems is the game is pretty repetitive where i&#39;m at 6 hours in and i am already finding it to be flightly repetitive with simple go here shoot loot and do it again.  6. Even though visually it isn&#39;t to good looking i still get only 30-40 fps, you may think oh thats your computers fualt well i&#39;m running a GTX 1060. Withcer 3 a game with a better draw distance and 100% much better graphics runs 60-70 fps solid almost all the time where here i never hit 50. It just isn&#39;t well optimized.  Ok the possitives:  1. The gun play is fun though with the repetitive nature of the game it can get boring is all around pretty solid, though there isn&#39;t a huge amount of guns to choose from it&#39;s still pretty solid. 2. Driving at leat on simulator is pretty solid though not to hard it does present some challenges. Gets you around pretty fast and is pretty fun for the most part. 3. The story seems to be going into a good place though only 6 hours in it is pretty interesting.\ 4. Cutscenes and voice acting is very good, faces look good and i just wish the game always sounded and looked as good as it does in the cut scenes.  Thats all i could think of i&#39;m sure i&#39;m missing quite a bit. Sorry for anything i misspelled my Grammar isn&#39;t the best.

Game is fun in the beginning but becomes pretty boring and repetitive after some hours...  The missions are always the same and dont change much. The only thing which motivates you is the story line, but its kinda hard to keep playing when doing the same things over and over again.   Graphics are good, but nothing special for 2016.

Was so hyped for this game, ended up dissapointed. The main flaw with this game is the waisted potential with the map. The map is so well done but they dont do ♥♥♥♥ with it. Ontop of that this game plays exactly like Lord Of The Rings Shadows Of Mordor, you kill a lieutenant which leads to the capo in whatever district (like an orc general in LOTR), eventually when you kill all of the Capos you get to kill the main bad guy aaaand THE END! Hangar 13 destroyed this game on so many levels including the whole frame rate debacle which just showed that they were hiding the fact that they didn&#39;t attempt to make a PC port for this game.   Here&#39;s a sparknotes Review of Mafia III:  Pros:  -Gunplay -The driving -Dialouge -Historical Accuracy -Story cutscenes -One of the best if not the best soundtrack in a video game -Setting of new orleans (not the graphics)  Cons: -No SLI support -Mafia II argueably looks better than this game -Free Roam aspect of the game is waisted potential -Stealth mechanic is so broken -You can easily take out an area of oppenets with a silenced weapon -Horrific AI -Textures are capped at 30 frames still -you can break any traffic law known to mankind and the cops will just ignore you  Verdict: 6/10  Even if the performence issues got patched ( which shouldnt have to be patched) the game is still not worth $60 wait for a steam sale or get it for christmas. There are so many mistakes of sloppy game development here I can sit here for hours telling you things they messed up.

After waiting for months for a decent game to come out I thought Mafia 3 would be the end to the boredom. How ever the game story is slow and the physics are just crap.  Ive now played 21 hours of this game as i thought it would get better the further i get into the story, i was wrong. For Lincoln being an ex SF he cant jump over walls that are clearly jumpable, he cant get up a small ledge from the water, as for the AI all you need to do is crouch (X) and litiarly walk up to an enemy in plain site he will see you but nor react and then strangle or punch him to death.   This game has every aspect of a good open world game but lack simple basic gameplay.  Very poor show.

Pros: +Good car handling +Combat is alright +The Story is pretty well made +Responsive AI Combat(partly) Cons: -Repetative missions -Autosave tends to just not work -Police are oblivious unlike other Mafia games -Not much to do outside of missions -The clothing animation tends to mess up in cutscenes -The unlocks are pretty much useless -Story feels more like a anti-racism campaign with random regurtitated nostalgia from other Mafia games. Overall: The game is playable, but has nothing to do with Mafia, with annoying bugs and pretty useless unlocks, rushed, buggy animations and overall a disappointment.

really, REALLY sad I have to write this review as someone who thoroughly enjoyed Mafia 2 seeing Mafia 3 in this state is depressing.  First of all I&#39;m not even going to mention the obvious flaws everyone is mentioning such as 30fps lock or the 720p textures.  But I am going to mention how horrible this game is to play visually.  In my short time playing the constant stuttering and bad lighting gave me a headache and hurt my eyes. Then for the icing on the cake the game randomly crashes on the opening mission and I am forced to ctrl+alt+delete out of the game, and I mean a complete crash too such as the whole game pausing, no modern AAA game should have those issues on a machine capable of playing this game on the max settings.  I was excited for this game and was a proud preorder customer of the deluxe edition because I was confident I would enjoy all the DLC as I did with Mafia 2. I paid £52.00 for this game and it is an unplayable mess.  This is truely disappointing. I am therefore doing something I didn&#39;t want or think I would do, refund my game.  until this game becomes enjoyable to play and not a headache inducing blurry piece of crap I won&#39;t be playing.  and as an added bonus to this review here is a nice bit of &#39;gameplay&#39;.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXvezu8K5pk

So .. ... ... Mafia 3. Another by the books open world game.  Lets just call it like it is:  You can beat the game whistling behind crates. What a masterpiece! You take down the Mafia whistling behind crates since the ai is programmed by people who apparently thinks gamers are children who dont like a challenge. Press a for cover, arrow left for whistle and b for kill. Is this ♥♥♥♥ what we want now? We have been brainwashed into thinking this is the norm for gaming. Since every open world game now have it. But its crap!  Seems like developers just go by a check box making these kinds of games: cover system for children - Check! Easy stealth with enemies who cant see or hear anything - Check! Open world busy stuff - Check! Poor ai - Check! Repetitive gameplay becuase gamers like busy work that will keep their brains in a loop of semi entertainment for hours!   The new word for reviews now: Addictive! This game is good because it is addictive! ♥♥♥♥ off! Thats not a word to describe anything good. If a game is addictive, thats a bad thing. What they really mean to say is immersive, but they dont know any better. Dont blame them. Thats whats happens when games like this is made over and over. Boring repetitive easy gameplay. Then its easy to confuse words like addictive with real emmersive gameplay.   Perhabs its time to wake up and smell the ♥♥♥♥ you are being fed. Because they can do better, but we dont demand better.   Btw. The story, characters and the world seems kinda cool and well made ^^

This is not a mafia game at all, it feels like you are some murderer wanting to kill  This game is just boring, I can&#39;t even get myself to play it anymore.  Go there, kill them, go back, and go and do it all over again until a boss arrives.  Now the story is meh, but my god is it a beautiful looking game.  now if you want a good mafia game, then play mafia 2 or 1.

Pros  - Soundtrack   Cons  - There is no mafia atmosphere  - Ugly low res textures in many places on max graphics  - Horrible shooting mechanics  - Driving controls are unrealistic.  - Game crashes   That game has no right to be called “Mafia”. Real name for this trash is “New Bordeaux Vermin”.

Game is unplayable. 30fps lock, stuttering, 2x crashed after a few minutes. I would wait for some patch to fix this.  **updated**:  Updated to latest patch. Game still randomly crashing (first time after 7min. in). 30fps is gone but performance is very poor still. It is just a very bad port. Not recommended to buy at this time and for sure not for full price.  If they can fix the main game maybe but actually its too late. Move on guys nothing to see here.

A combination of this game, no man&#39;s sky and homefront: the revolution, taught me not to trust a damn thing the devs showcase before the release of their game and to not trust games that have no review codes.  My biggest grudge is the all of this terrible visuals on a triple A title. It&#39;s riddled with visual bugs from the sky to the shadows and the awful draw distance and half the time the visuals don&#39;t fully render unless you look from the right angle, and even when you do, it&#39;s still poo-poo quality. There is a magnitude of bugs and the crappy AI just put a nail in it&#39;s coffin.  The driving is fun in this game and the frame rate is OK for me (80fps @ 1440p with a 1080) but I wouldn&#39;t say it&#39;s the same for everyone. (especially considering it has worse textures that GTA V which was released 3 years ago).  This game will get repetetive after ~ 2 hours or so. All the tasks are generally the same with little plot difference, go in, try to be stealthy or not, kill everyone, destroy everything, interrogate some guy and either recruit him or kill him. It&#39;s practically the opposite of mafia 2 was, where mafia 2 had little to do outside of missions, this game is a lot of repetetive mandatory stuff outside story that give you no satisfaction or addition to story. The story itself isn&#39;t any good either, it&#39;s something you see from miles away, you already know what&#39;s gonna happen so after a while, there&#39;s no urge to see it through either.  There&#39;s one good thing about the story though, and that&#39;s the way you treat your underbosses and the multiple &#39;after endings&#39;. (ending is still kill sal, you&#39;ll make choices as to what happens after though). You can split everything even between bosses, make one or two feel alienated and give all power to the other two/ one guy that is your fav or you can just screw all of em over and keep everything for yourself. So at the end you come to these choices (spoilers)    endings are rule together, rule alone or leave the city..... the 3rd option leaves whoever has most earn to run the city.   There&#39;s also side missions (underboss loyality missions) that you can do to learn more about them. For example what happened to Joe explained by Vito.  There are few strong point to this game, one of which is the somewhat accurate description of racisim in that time period, something that you can see today as well. The soundtrack is also pretty good and the world looks really good (in terms of design). The textures of buildings actually render ok, it&#39;s everything else that is awful. Listening to the in car radio talk about the current events or some dude rambling is pretty fun too, but it only has 1 station and gets repetetive after a while (especially since by the 4th hour you&#39;ve heard every song 10 times over). The voice acting and facial animations are also pretty solid, let down by textures and bugs however. Now all this being said, it does not justify piracy, if you want to pirate it, watch a youtube playthrough/game movie instead. People still worked on this pile of crap, the overall result might not be satisfactory, but it doesn&#39;t justify piracy. I say that because i&#39;m an artist and I understand this stuff. The polishing team didn&#39;t do their job, but there were still people who voice acted, animators, concept artists and so more that did their job.  If you really want it, grab it at 50%-75% off.

The atmosphere, storyline, voice acting and the soundtrack to the game are strong points but this is let down by the technical issues and repetition. There is little variety in the mission content, you take over territories in a typical open world manner without a variety of enemies. The gunfights are fluid but the gameplay is let down by the repetitive stealth mechanic in the game. Overall, Mafia III does not offer enough content for a large open world game and the lack of mission variety, enemies and activities is not up to the standard that you would expect from a major title in 2016.  The main protagonist can see through walls with an X-Ray abiliity and this is highly unrealistic for a game based in the 1960&#39;s. The user interface doesn&#39;t suit a historial period piece at all, it is very patronising and it even indicates what button to press to open a car door. This would be acceptable in a Batman game but Mafia III is a gritty, realistic third person shooter set in the past and the user interface and the superpower ability detracts from the immersion.  The game would receive a recommendation as not many single player games in 2016 have offered such a high quality of story and voice acting but that could change with Dishonoured 2 coming out next month. The lack of polish with the graphics, technical issues and the repetition prevent this game from reaching the heights of previous Mafia titles.

When they uncapped the FR from 30 performance was poor on my GTX 970 with dips and glitches.

Well what can you say that already has not been said.  This game is a mess that could have been something much much better.  The game is very and I mean very repetetive with capturing districs by talking to someone, interrogate some people, kill some people and boxes and such then you kill or recruit the district&#39;s boss and so on till the end of the game. If that is repetetive as hell then I don&#39;t know what is.  As the story missions though some of them are quite unique and others feel kinda meh.  If they put more thought into the story missions and changed the way you capture districs it would have been a different story.  The gameplay feels okay i guess, I went the stealth path which is pretty satisfying from my experience.  The graphics are... well... I played the game when it just release so... there were issues. The game looked bad on high settings, there was an FPS cap to 30 (now fixed) and it just didn&#39;t that great of a game. It had a lot of bugs and if they only worked on the game more and polished it, it would look better and run better.  The story was a good old fashioned revenge story, Linclon as a character was this big badass guy who won&#39;t let anyone stop him and the other characters were entertaining as well and great voice overs. The district missions kind of distracted me from the story but the story was good in my opinion.  Lastly if you&#39;re buy the game you are gonna get either bored or have fun killing people in different places.  And also buy it on sale aint worth 60 dollars.(20 dollars sure)

*This review is made after the 60 fps patch  Mafia 3 is one of the worst console to PC ports I&#39;ve experienced in years. Other similar games such as GTA5, The Witcher 3, Mad Max, all look vastly superior visually and perform at a solid 60 fps @ 1400p w/ ultra settings, while mafia 3 flucuates wildly between 30-60 fps all the while looking like a last gen game with some of the worst textures I&#39;ve seen since ps3 ports.  The controls suck. And the interface is ridiculously frustrating.   Only good thing about the game? A superb soundtrack. CCR is the greatest band of all time.  Bottom line: DON&#39;T BUY MAFIA 3 (unless you are satisfied with driving around New Orleans listening to some great late 60&#39;s music and nothing else.)

Just finished the main story line without skipping any cutscenes in roughly 27 hours. Kinda feels like playing an updated version of The Godfather II.  Cut-scenes and voice acting are amazing, but the game get&#39;s a bit dull after taking over five rackets. Also lacks customization features like most other games in this genre and the previous Mafia (II). I felt rather dirty wearing the same uniform for 27 hours!   It feels like the team has delivered a &#39;half&#39; product. Earlier today I read their new announcement of what free content will be added in the coming months.. Luckily it&#39;s for free, but unfortunately it&#39;ll also be too late.  If you are a Mafia fan this game comes highly recommended, however for the average gamer I would suggest to wait a bit and get it when the price comes down. Therefore I do not recommend this game at the moment, there are better ways to spend 50+ dollars instead of buying half a game.  After the recent updates it&#39;s still not worth the money.

First time in years that a game does not even start after clicking on the exe.file ...... AMD Card with latest drivers and latest Windows 10. There is no error, no notification or whatsoever, it simply loading for a couple of seconds and stops right after it. Latest patch is installed.  The devs should really be ashamed of providing this piece of software ♥♥♥♥ to PC-Gaming....  Edit: It seems that it is due to the fact that AMD Phenom II CPUs are not supported by the current version of the game.... All other mordern games run fine with my system set-up, but a modest current-gen console port like this is not supposed to work. I really hope that the devs will fix this.  Question: Was any PhenomII user out there able to start this game somehow?

Agreed with many other users posts, that being; game is unacceptable and needs work. I shouldn&#39;t be crashing randomly 20 minutes into the game. I could handle the 30 FPS limit if they game was stable at the moment. That being said, my personal experience with this game ... not happy. I&#39;ve read a few other posts where individuals mentioned they were unhappy with the graphics; I also concur. More or less, game looks washed, grainy, outdated, etc. Yes, I agree a good storyline makes a game. We&#39;ve all played games where the story kept us entertained rather then the graphics, sound, or even the gameplay for the matter. However, this is 2016 and the bar has been raised for console and PC gameing alike. Not complaining, demanding, or pointing fingers. Just not understanding how all us PC gamers have to wait and cross our fingers to hope everything will work right. First Forza probelms, now Mafia III probelms. Let me guess, Gears 4 ... problems? Just saying....ok, I&#39;m done.

This game is so poorly optimized for PC that it is unplayable, even with a really beefy PC it suffers from brutal FPS drops and constant microstuttering. Whatever graphical settings you use, the result is the same. Not one word about this from Hangar 13 either, so I would presume that the issues is not even on their fix list. Had I bought this in the Steam store, I would have asked for a refund after less than an hour of gameplay. Don´t waste your money on this crappy excuse for a game.

Excellent story line. Going strong till now. Environment has been captured perfectly. But awful PC optimazation. I don&#39;t know if the testers were drunk while testing but a lot of bugs. I won&#39;t recommend till those issues are fixed.

Yes, I waited for the 30fps-unlock-patch, and I waited for the next one, still, my opinion didn&#39;t really change, and if, just got worse..because, it still runs like ♥♥♥♥, performance is still bad (I just finished QB, looks awesome, runs nice), the weather looks terrible at times, and sometimes it switches between ugly rain and nasty sunshine in a second. overall not a pretty game. and the game itself is not very good either..is not just the performance..do you basically always the same, interogate, kill, destory, and begin again. the only really good thing about mafia 3 is the soundtrack, great selection of Soul, RnB, RnR. get the soundtrack, forget the game. 3/10

While there are minor improvements to some of the overworld elements in Mafia II, overall this game is a huge step down in quality. It feels less like a Mafia game and more of a collect-a-thon similar to Assassins Creed, as well as having some of the most boring optional side missions I have ever played, leaving me struggling to stay awake. I guess that&#39;s where the difficulty is supposed to be found?

I had to change my review. At first I did recommend it, It runs ok on my system. I have had 4 or 5 crashes in 20 hours of gameplay. Graphics look better when on a LOWER setting, yes LOWER. On high the reflections just ruin the look of the game. The AI have random moments of madness when driving and start driving around in circles, including the police. So if your driving fast down a road you don&#39;t see it coming and SMASH! As people have mentioned, I arrived at a optional mission last night after a 15 minute drive to find the truck I was supposed to be taking wasn&#39;t there. The game is really poorly optimized, It&#39;s far from finished. The story is great and loads to do but that is ruined by the bugs and graphics. The devs, release one patch to unlock FPS WHICH SHOULDN&#39;T HAVE BEEN LOCKED IN THE FIRST PLACE! Now....... well that&#39;s it. No info on next patch, no reply to anyone as far as I know. Looks like they are more interested in the other games they released recently. SO.... I would say, in it&#39;s current state It&#39;s not worth the money. Who knows when it will be fixed and good luck getting any support! POOR 2K!

I have a GTX 1060 and even on low settings I can&#39;t get 60 fps all of the time. Also the stuttering is terrible. I wonder if the developers even played the game on lower end cards because you&#39;ll need a lot more then what the system requirements suggest to play this game.

hello,   I have played the game till the end, and i must say im a bit dissappointed. The story is cool, but for a game that is made in 2016 its bad because your doing the same thing over and over again. Just in a other district.   Buy the game when its in sale or much cheaper.

Now, i wouldn&#39;t say that this is directly a bad GAME, but a truly horrible interpretation of a Mafia-game. There is almost nothing resembling it&#39;s predecessors, it&#39;s a disgrace to the loved series. It has no &#39;mafia feel&#39;, the era is poorly captivated, the streets look dead, and is nothing near what was expected from it. This - for me - was supposed to be the revival of the Mafia-series, the one that i&#39;ve been a fan of ever since i layed my hands upon Mafia I. It disappointed me from the Mafia perspective in ever single way, i&#39;ve uttered myself to play game for as long as i have, but no more. I&#39;ve gotten an insight in what this game is trying to be, that&#39;s enough. I will be leaving out the technical quirks the game has, since there&#39;s a billion other reviews for that.  Hangar 13 made this game into a grindfest with a very uninteresting plot which featured next to nothing compelling. The plot (briefly summarized) is about a man named Lincoln, a Vietnam veteran coming home (they could&#39;ve hit homerun with this story even though it&#39;s very generic). He finds himself lacking stuff to do and feels overall useless, so he joins a gang (I honestly don&#39;t remember the name of the gang, but it&#39;s the Italian counterpart of the Black mafia). He meet&#39;s up with the leader and they plot a heist, the italian&#39;s end up betraying him and the black mafia. Resulting in them all dying except Lincoln whom is now pumped with bloodlust and revenge. Sounds generic? Well, it unfortuantley is.  The game itself is okay, the gameplay is okay, very generic and all in all just completely O.K. nothing revolutionary. Never the less, the place where the game really shines is in it&#39;s cutscenes, oh my god are they good. They are infact revolutionary, i have never seen better. They have an immense attention to details in the characters face, and it&#39;s surroundings featuring some insane graphics in the cutscenes, but this is unfortunatley the only place the game really shows it&#39;s features to me. It&#39;s like two different worlds, there&#39;s the low polygon, poorly made player controlled world. Then there&#39;s the highly detailed cut-scene world. How did you possibly go so wrong Hangar 13? I feel I&#39;m bored out of my mind with the same missions on repeat in each of the 9 districts the game is divided in, and it turns into this agonistic behaviour where the one grind tries to be better and stronger than the other grind. There&#39;s NO variation what so ever. Sure, you might be into this kind of thing where there&#39;s an openworld grind, but this is no storydriven game at all.   I find myself disheartened, uncompelled, disappointed and lost in faith for this game and it&#39;s future franchise (?). I hope so very dearly that the devs will find themselves wise enough to play through all the games, then come to the conclusion that they made a grave mistake in releasing this game as it is. May they create a new game that mends my sore eyes after playing this. May Mafia 4 be a better one than this. If not, the franchise will die and my faith in 2K will be lost.  3/10 coming from a Mafia fan.  5/10 coming from a gamer.

The gunplay is good, the atmosphere is good and (mostly) authentic, and the story (so far 21 hours in) is reasonable. That was all the good things i have to say about Mafia 3. The graphics and driving mechanics are a huge step down from the (six years older!) predecessor, and the protagonist is amazingly even less relatable and interesting than was the case in Mafia 2. The idea with you having &#39;underbosses&#39; to help you is good, but the execution is almost laughably bad, none of their bonuses really add anything, apart from the one you get when you originally acquire them, and leave no reason for you to care about which boss you choose. Naturally the game is far from reliable, with quite a few crashes straight to desktop, in seemingly random places, and even though the graphics are notably worse than Mafia 2, the game still has really bad problems with unstable, and generally poor, framerates. All of this is pushed in the background, however, when it comes to the missions. There is NO and that is _*NO*_ variation at all, in the missions after the introduction of the general mechanics of the game. Every single mission is: Drive to this highlighted place on the map, shoot everyone there, and pick up anything that grows green in your magical see-through-walls-vision. That&#39;s it. Nothing else. And even though this seems like a rather easy thing to manage, the game engine still manages to mess that up, repeatedly removing the icons from the map, never to be seen again (until you restart the game anyway), and the AI of enemies is beyond stupid, with them wading slowly towards the sound of me, completely oblivious to the ten dead bodies of their allies lying in the exact same spot, where i can just point my gun and wait for them. The design of the shooting galleries is rather bad as well, with virtually no levels that has more than one or two entrances, and almost no possibilities of playing a more stealthy approach.  All in all this game is on a level i expect from a €10 game from some backwater startup developer, who bit of more than they could chew, not a fully priced AAA-title from a company that has shown that could make superior games half a decade ago!  Avoid this game like the devil, until it&#39;s on sale dirt cheap, it&#39;s really not worth the price!

Wouldve loved for this game to be good. But its missing SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO many things. What it does good is graphics, characters and the beginning of the story.  The city feels empty, theres nothing you can do or spend your money on, youre the don honcho and yet youre doing all the stuff that a lowlevel gangster would do, after a while its the same missions over and over again only different sites/scenes.  It has good ideas (the taking over the city part/revenge story/and underbosses) but it never fully catches that because it lacks so many things if it wants to be an open world.

I had such high hopes for this game. Boy was I disappointed! The story is good, but the missions are so repetative they feel like what most games would call side quests. I actually felt more engaged with No Mans Sky than I do with Mafia 3, thats how hollow and badly structured this game feels.

It&#39;s an ok game at best. Got no issues with the graphics, sound, gameplay, character design. If anything, the Story is great ( cutscenes, dialogue execution ) - the immersion experience is commendable - this is where your money is going.   I would like to recommend this game on full price, BUT the mission design killed it in as far as expectations from an AAA title. It&#39;s repetitive for the most part. Mafia II was definitely better in this aspect. There were many opportunities to design the missions with more variety but I didn&#39;t see that for M3.  I recommend this title only for when it&#39;s on sale, unless they do something drastic about the mission designs in the future.

Alright, after playing the game for a few hours and getting into the gameplay i can now officially say that this game is &#39;OK&#39;  Pros:  -The games story is amazing, phenomenal, even. -Time period is captured accturately and portrayed as it should be. -Soundtrack is awesome. -Gunplay is what i expected to be, somewhat modeled after mafia 2.  Now to the bad  Cons: -Consistant crashes, especially in the downtown area (every 30 minutes to an hour the game crashes, sometimes less) -Pop ins, this is a minor problem and can usually be ignored if aren&#39;t focusing on it. -Gameplay is somewhat repetetive, although it reminds me of godfather 2 which i actually liked. -Some serious lighting problems, although this can be rectified by downloading a shader (Still, something you shouldn&#39;t have to do with a so called &#39;triple A title&#39;) -Vito does not look like vito, like, at all.  I&#39;ve been a serious fan of the mafia series since the first one, and had been patiently awaiting this game&#39;s release, but what i recieved for my 80$(CAD) was an unfinished mess. If more time had been allocated to this game and the release day pushed back it could have been better, the game has the poetential but just not the heart unlike mafia 2.

Bought this game in preorder deluxe edition because of old love to Mafia 3. At release I was mad at 30fps lock , but decided to give it a try and look into this game as a whole not just by graphics. Thus I decided to write this now.   TL;DR   Don&#39;t buy it, game is worth 20$ for me not 50$.   Long version:   Graphics is a bit avarage. For a price of 50$ I expect something good, not excelent, but good. Story is intresting at start but after couple of hours it is dull and I stoped caring about protagonist, sidekicks or even villans. Immersion is top notch at begginig but after couple of hours I realised that I cannot interact with any occuring events (some people are being stoped by police) apart shoting them. Character progression, building own &#39;mafia&#39; is boring. Its just simple give district to one of 3 sidekicks. Tried diffrent combination and as far as I can tell it does not make any diffrence who gets what. Some of side missions are cool and kept me enterteined. Collectibles do not grant You anything. Not even collecting music records opens new songs in radio. There is no benefit from doing it. From 4 first districts I&#39;ve collected everything, even dig through trash (not true) and after realising it acomplish nothing I decided not to waste more time on it. I love how cinematics look and thats some of major plus for this game. Also voice acting is awesome. I like how enemies reacts to bullet impact. There is no melee combat what so ever. More about how bad this game is look on Youtube for Mafia 2 vs Mafia 3.   DO NOT BUY THIS GAME FOR FULL PRICE

This review is coming from a big fan of Mafia 2. I played Mafia 1 also but only once. I was really grabbed by the 2nd game in the series - the setting, the music, the story, the graphics even. All was very well done and with a thought.  Playing Mafia 3 is a disappointment. -The graphics are horrendous - they are like from a game from 10 years ago - there is a muddy filter applied on your screen. Whoever thought this is ok for 2016 is a challenged person. Thank God there is a custom graphics mod that makes the game look acceptable. If you decide to play this game, look for it: &#39;Nyclix&#39;s official colour correction reshade&#39;. The thing that it cannot fix though is the draw distance. Stuff at a relatively near distance are a lot blurred. The day/night cycling is a joke too. It is like hitting a dark shadow wall when it becomes night. -The story as a concept sounds great and there are various cut scenes that are created professionally. However, playing through the story gets boring quick - for every district you have to do one and the same thing - go steal something at place A. Interrogate an informant at place B. After that you face the disctrict boss at one of the same places - A or B. That&#39;s about it. -Most of the Playboy pictures are the same from Mafia 2 :D There are some new collectibles with naked girls but they are drawn. -Speaking of collectibles - there is no achievement(s) for it. That&#39;s a real let down for an achievement hunter and this could have squeezed lots of extra hours of gameplay for some people. +The music is good as the previous (if you like such type of music), but they did not compose it so it is hard to mess that up. +A big plus of Mafia 3, especially compared to Mafia 2, is the gameplay length. However, this comes at the expense of quaility. At the time of writing I have played nearly 20 hours and I am not sure that I am nearing the end yet. The previous game could be completed easily in below 10 hours.  Conclusion Devs nowadays are trying too hard to make new game part of a successful series and they end up making it too different and with less features than the previous. There are lot of examples for this and Mafia 3 has become part of that group. Anyway, if you are a Mafia fan I would suggest first playing a few missions through alternative means and if you like it - buy the game then.

OK, so it&#39;s 30+ hrs of gameplay and about 4hrs are truly fun, BUT where this game is good is the story. The post-credits cutscene is surely one of the best moments ever, but is this game worth buying? No! Don&#39;t! It&#39;s generic and is a bad GTA wannabe, but if they ever made a movie with this skill as they have their cutscenes we&#39;d have another &#39;Goodfellas&#39; &#39;Casino&#39; and &#39;Donnie Brasco&#39; all in one. Overall 6/10

I really enjoy this game. I really do. The animations are beautiful. The cutscenes are beautiful. The car driving could be better, but at least its unique in its own way. The guns are so satisfying to use.  But. There&#39;s a ton of things about this game that disappoint. The textures are complete ♥♥♥♥ on anything except priamary NPCs. Its embarrassing. It&#39;s like looking at the ground in vanilla Skyrim. It makes me want to throw up. You worked on this game for how long? This is what it looks like. ♥♥♥♥.  The light is terrible anywhere outside. Everything is washed out and tries to cover up the terrible textures. Its also finicky and flashes around when turning the camera 180.  Also, your settings menu is really frustrating to use. I understand why you have an app launcher. You obviously couldnt figure out how to use an &#39;apply&#39; function. Anytime I switch a setting, it immediately activates it. Going from windowed to fullscreen crashed the game twice. I have to play it in windowed because it wont started without glitching around at fullscreen. And seriously? No option for borderless windowed?  I enjoy the game. It works sometimes and I enjoy playing it. The story is amazing, so far. The gameplay is great. But these things that should be standard in a game on PC are missing. It makes the experience less than enjoyable. I cannot recommend this game.

Ok so basically these companies don&#39;t want us to play games on pc anymore? They all want us to buy a console? Thats the conclusion I have come to after the last couple of years worth of games that run and look great on console but then look and run like crap on pc. Well the videos and screenshots look GLORIOUS but then we play and think... I waited for this...? Oh and I need to have a pc rig that is worth (roughly) $2000 compared to a $500 console to run the game smoothly and actually play it? AND it doesnt even really look much better... How does that make any sense guys... As a fan of games and pc&#39;s this is just downright depressing. Not just this game, but so many other games as well are not seeming to care about pc users very much if at all. Perhaps a minimum amount of caring to squeeze peoples wallets but thats about it?  Man I&#39;m done with any hype for any game. Never pre-ordering again. Never looking at another gameplay video before the game exists. The pc game market is failing horribly imo too much just lately, although there have been a few gems, so many AAA titles over the last year have just been outright disappointing and overhyped. Then add the dlc factor and tbh it makes me wish I didn&#39;t even play games. Look at what they are doing with hitman, we are like guinea pigs now they just want to see how much they can get away with? I feel like a person who has been hooked by a dealer on some really strong stuff, and now that they have me hooked they just want to sell me poor quality and less weight like I&#39;m some slave sucker to thier product. Sadest part is there is probably some great moments in these games and genuine quality but how can I enjoy it when I&#39;m so distracted by massive technical fails and this general philosophy these games companies seem to have now of &#39;oh we don&#39;t need to optimise our code just buy a more powerful pc and horsepower your way through&#39;... no man, just no. I&#39;m not falling for it ok. And no just enabling over 30 fps isnt going to fix the performance or visuals... so don&#39;t bother replying and tell me to wait for a over 30fps patch ok? Thats not going to mean anything to me when i get 20 fps in lowest settings on this game on a rig that runs gta 5 at 60+ mostly on high settings, and does this game look better than gta 5... nope.  I know this isn&#39;t the place for talking about other games, but this is my review/rant, noone is paying me like others get paid to write favorable reviews... so i will write what i damn well please. Don&#39;t like it steam? Ok then delete my reviews like you have done before. It&#39;s all about damage control anyway these days with these forums etc, you might think they represent freedom of speech but they don&#39;t always if at all. It&#39;s freedom of speech until you say something the majority doesn&#39;t like, then you must stfu right steam/valve/negative reviewers who are probably mostly teams of devs voting to protect thier poor quality game... yeah well good luck with that guys have fun. /refunded.

Why is this a stealth game? Why does this game look like it came out in 2012, Why does the movement feel so awkward? It&#39;s boring with the stealth tactics, Doesnt feel like Mafia II the same animation over and over again knocking people out with your gun yeah yeah.

All of this doesn&#39;t help the fact that the game has generally poor visuals; another downgrade from an impressive E3 demo.

total let down, wouldn&#39;t launch after install until i spent 2 hours on the internet looking for problem only to find i had to re-install the .net frameworks, looks like a playstation 2 game, cars pop in about 50 feet away, cut scenes look amazing then when gameplay starts they look like plasticine men, terrible console port with no effort whatsoever made to make it pc quality, the only saving grace is if i paid 55 pound for it on my PS4 i&#39;d be even more hacked off.poor show 2K games poor show, stick to making sports titles where you can handle developing the simple content

The game has a 30 fps lock which sucks but i can live with. if you play with a controller you dont see that much of a difference in game resonsose compared to a mouse. BUT if you use a mouse the game it self feels very slow, and fast mouse movements mean an ugly and unimmersive video.  So just play with a controller right? Wrong... If you play the game with a controller all help screens and tooltips just say something like this:  Press to Accelerate  instead of Press RB to Accesserate  Normaly i could live with that but i was litteraly lock in the first room for 5 min. because I did know how to open the god damn door

Outdated graphics, lackluster gameplay, uninspired story.  The graphics are like a really bad painting. The gameplay is so repetitive I thought that I was dying of boredom. The story is cookiecutter ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t with a little bit of PTSD strewn in.   There is nothing to do apart from killing and looting people and then going to the next location to kill and loot people. The only interesting people are those you have to kill and I am sad to say that they ruined Vito Scarletta. He was such a badass character in Mafia 2 and even though he &#39;wakes up&#39; when you recruit him, he remains such a miniscule side character they should have just left him out of this one.  2K games is the new EA games. Every game gets progressively worse. If I didn&#39;t have hope that it will improve I would have gladly returned it.  I know that they will include some stuff that might improve upon this pile of ♥♥♥♥, like more weapons and outfits and including races and other side stuff, but that is too late. If you try to copy GTA do it well or not at all.

Dear Hangar 13,  Clearly you and I need to sit down and have a serious discussion about what constitutes £53 of video game.  See, I&#39;m one of those &#39;play for the story and gameplay&#39; types, I don&#39;t really care that much about fancy graphics and I can&#39;t see the difference between 30FPS and 60FPS. That&#39;s a category I&#39;d comfortably fit in, given any other situation. However, if I stated I was the kind&#39;ve person who ate ice cream all the time, you&#39;d sensibly infer to be alive I must also eat other things. In this situation, my former claim must also be taken with an equal pinch of salt and the optical migraine that is this £53 pile of ♥♥♥♥ is driving me mad. My intention was to file for a refund although since it&#39;s taken me 2 hours to play through the introduction of the game, apparently I am no longer eligible to do so. I suppose that would be my own fault for spending so much of it trying to figure out how to make the game playable in the menus.  I paid £53 in good faith based on the excellence that was Mafia 2. What you have delivered is a visual downgrade from Mafia 2. Hell, what you delivered is a visual downgrade from GTA: San Andreas! It looks like it belongs on a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ed PS2. This is not acceptable. To add insult to this injury, every few minutes there&#39;s a cutscene reminding me how beautiful the game was in the trailers, the end of which I&#39;m forced to readjust my eyes, feel intense disappointment and continue through the objectives.  I simply cannot enjoy this. It&#39;s using none of my computer&#39;s capability, it&#39;s running at maximum settings yet it has about 20ft of draw distance. Anything less than 5ft away is a textural smear which would constitute a reasonable criticism of a £10 indie title.  Now, let&#39;s get started on this thing you&#39;ve coded the camera to do while driving. So, car goes vroom vroom, wheels probably spin and stuff, can&#39;t really tell from the graphics, but I digress. You give me, the player, the capacity to make the metal box of vrooms move around. Why is it I&#39;m not given the same capacity to control the camera in order to look where I&#39;m bloody going? Why is it I am given the capacity to move the vehicle, yet I&#39;m considered too irresponsible by your incompetant development team to aim my camera where I mean to look? Was it assumed that I would abuse the system and look around, having an unfair amount of spacial awareness in a singleplayer game or something?  To put this camera situation into perspective, some poor neckbeard in your studio has had to code a coroutine that runs every few seconds to initiate this cancer, then a lerp to move the camera smoothly back where it is of no ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ed use, plus any other bits and pieces in order to ensure it is as far from being a smooth, sensible or helpful thing as possible. What level of incompetancy do you have to be operating at to pay your employees to make your product worse?  Finally, the gunplay. I blitzed through Mafia 2 before this was released psyching myself up for what I assumed would be a better version. I&#39;m intensely disappointed to encounter a combat system where solo enemies yell loudly to themselves about whether or not they can see me. While engaged in an active firefight, I duck behind a building to reload and by the time I move around the other side of it the enemies are either having discussion with themselves or eachother about how I&#39;m probably not even there anymore. It&#39;s like gunfighting the developmentally disabled. I just wanna give these poor mentally challenged Haitans a hug. Perhaps not, I don&#39;t like being drooled on.  Next up, this inaccuracy thing needs to go to bed and not wake up. I&#39;m supposedly playing as the most badass man in New Orleans here. If I, in real life, can consistently hit a man sized target 5 metres away with a handgun, why can&#39;t he? I would intensely like to gripe about a general lack of damage on certain things that should actually do damage, such as the M14, but I understand that lowering damage is a gameplay choice that perhaps makes gunfighting a little bit more accessible for the casuals. So, I&#39;m not happy about that, I&#39;d like a representative damage model for the guns ideally, but there&#39;s no way you can justify the need to empty magazine after magazine to kill a guy 5 metres away. Walking forward out of cover, up to the enemy to shoot him should not be the dominant combat strategy on the hardest difficulty level, which at the moment it very, very much is. (Otherwise you have no ammo and the enemy&#39;s still alive.)  So in a little over 2h of play I&#39;ve been about as disappointed as this one time when I was a small child I left my cuddly cat toy on a plane when I came home from a holiday. That&#39;s a hell of a lot of first-world disappointment right there.  £53 for this unfinished mess is pretty terrible, but for the disappointment I should be legally entitled to forward you the bill for a professional therapist.

I will start my review by saying, I waited for this game for months, I love what they did with the previous games Mafia 1 and Mafia 2. WHAT THE ♥♥♥ ! In 2016 playing games on a $3K pc can’t pass the 30fps limitation, not yet have to wait for the patch, few more days. They didn’t think about it before the release or they want to make us feel the slanginess and low quality specs of a console? I wonder what makes them do that? I will not change my review even after the patch will fix this unacceptable first day experience with the game and that because is hard to believe is even happening.

PROS: - First 3 hours of gameplay are really great and enjoyable. - America&#39;s 60s - New Orleans...ehm..Bordeaux - America&#39;s 60s - Soundtrack! - America&#39;s 60s - Cars!  CONS: - Pretty much everything else. (Story. Missions. AI. Repetitiveness of game mechanics. You name it.)  Let me be perfectly clear. It&#39;s NOT a bad game! It is just very poor Mafia game. Everyone who played 2 previous titles knows how story-centric these were. You simply can&#39;t remove storytelling from Mafia and expect that you will get away with it. Unfortunately, thats exactly how this game feels - like a sprinter who tries to run a marathon. First 3 hours of gameplay are a blast and then entire experience dies slowly. We already have a great sandbox game which does it very well - GTA. Mafia used to be open world story driven game and thats what players expected and didn&#39;t get. There is no reason pretending that Mafia is anywhere near to qualities of GTA 5 when it comes to variety of activities.  Result: Establish Czech development team again, hang budget cutting managers on the nearest tree and let former team do it properly. Unfortunately, Hangar 13 doesn&#39;t seem to have a clue about what original Mafia games really were about. If you really like America&#39;s 60s its worth a shot, though.

This review is only here to say that they did fix the incompatibility for older cpus. That said, the game is bland, extremely poorly optimised (i get sub 25fps in the city with low-medium settings on a phenom II x6 and an r9 280 with 16gb ram.) Unless you can get it for $10 (like i did) then its not worth the purchase.

1: Go to objective 2: Kill, interrogate, and/or destroy crates 3: Leave 4: Rinse and repeat until the game is over  The most fun I had was during the introduction; the missions actually felt unique from one another. After that, I can&#39;t remember any details of the missions that followed, because they were basically the same as the last one with a small change in scenery and a different cutscene. This game lacks a lot of the variety that Mafia II had. The story itself is pretty interesting, but it starts to become a pain having to force yourself through the same tedious missions to get to the cutscenes. Overall, it&#39;s OK. Not great, just OK.  Edit: I&#39;ve gotten to a point that I can&#39;t finish the story. If I have to go to &#39;X&#39; and kill &#39;Y&#39; one more time, I&#39;m going to kill myself.

Final thoughts: Leave this genre to Rockstar please. If you&#39;re aiming for mediocre, why even bother making the game? There&#39;s only one reason: quick cash grab. This game will be added to the looooong list of forgotten, bland and boring titles that the industry spits out whenever the shareholders needs a quick cash injection.  ***  (1 hour) Good concept, but poorly executed. 5-6/10 so far. Will update.  ***  (10 hours) 5/10. The end. Well almost:  + I like the driving mechanics. It reminds me of GTA IV.  - Weak story - Very repetitive missions and side missions - Poor visuals - Poor physics - Forgettable characters  Unless you&#39;re on heavy medication, and like repetition, skip this one.

If you don&#39;t feel like reading this entire thing, the long and short of it is that, as a VERY steadfast Mafia fan, this is not only a disservice to the series but to this style of open world game.  Throughout most of my playtime I was planning on keeping the tagline to this review, &#39;Mafia III isn&#39;t a BAD game, but...&#39; However, after I spent more and more time with the game, I can no longer say it isn&#39;t a bad game. There are many factors that play into this and it&#39;s unfortunate that they are also the factors that comprise roughly ninety percent of the game.  First and foremost, many of the negative reviews on here mention repetition to an extreme degree. They&#39;re correct, though I wouldn&#39;t say the repetition is what kills it (after all, GTAV is a series of missions to drive a car somewhere and shoot people as well), but the fact that there&#39;s so little variation to the main gameplay loop. This consists of driving to a location of roughly a dozen enemies, getting out of your car, and killing them, all while also doing a few tiny extra things like destruction or interrogation. This wouldn&#39;t be so bad if they were more substantial or involved, but sadly they all take roughly a minute to do and then you have to drive around and do another exact copy of this same activity. It&#39;s extremely grating.  Beyond that, there&#39;s the driving. This is hands down, the absolute worst open world driving I&#39;ve experienced in years. It&#39;s really two different parts that combine into a horrible whole. The first is the fact that the cars handle terribly. This is to be expected as it has been with the previous two Mafia games and the cars drive like the vehicles of the period would. But they seem to be worse off and harder to control than the older and lesser vehicles from the past two games. When you add on to this the second and FAR more egregious problem of how the environment handles these cars the experience is incredibly unpleasant. Nearly every object in the game, including bushes and small objects, act like solid concrete blocks that weigh more than your car. A light tap or grazing of anything will INSTANTLY stop your car dead in its tracks. Several smaller objects and the railroad tracks also have the ability to send your car flying literally thirty feet in the air while flipping end over end. This truly is the worst open world driving I&#39;ve experienced in many, many years.  Another mark against the game is the AI. The previous two titles never had anything resembling good AI, but somehow in this one the NPCs have regressed in both combat and driving ability even further. The combat AI has a habit of either shooting from behind cover endlessly, or blindly charging past your cover. This leads to frustration in that the game was designed as a cover-based shooter and you weren&#39;t meant to have bullet-sponge enemies charging past you and shooting you in the back. The traffic AI is worse than usual open world fare, and the cop chases deserve special mention. The cop AI is tenacious and uses a system akin to GTAIV. You have a circle of intrigue where they will chase you and all you need to do is exit this circle to throw them off. Sadly, the game has a habit of spawning police cruisers DIRECTLY in front of you during a chase and have them ram you. This refreshes the circle, heavily damages your vehicle while bringing it to a dead stop, and allows the cars you were outrunning to catch up. They also have sniper-like accuracy while firing from a moving vehicle and routinely destroy your tires which ruins the car&#39;s already poor handling. Add to this the aforementioned issue with minor obstacles completely stopping your car and the chases are infinitely frustrating.  Beyond the design flaws are the technical ones. The game has MANY triggers or scripts that are easily and unintentionally broken. In the past five hours I played tonight I had a mission-centric NPC that was following me get locked out of the room we were supposed to enter (which broke a separate script) and left him unable to open doors for me to exit, I punched an NPC through a cage containing our fight which left him orbiting the ring outside unable to continue the fight, and had a mission-centric vehicle not register that I had gotten into it or that I blew it up in an attempt to reset it. The game will often spawn a copy of something inside of itself leading to cars suddenly and randomly exploding fifty feet into the air and a hilarious series of doppelgangers of your main cohorts in the storyline. This is in addition to the DOZENS of crashes I&#39;ve had to endure while attempting to make progress in the game.  There is some good in this game. The main story, its missions, and the writing, dialog, and voice acting are all first rate and top notch. They&#39;re a return to Mafia form and these highlights almost make the game worth suffering through to get to. The visuals are fantastic and the lip syncing and facial expressions are deserving of extra praise. The gunplay feels fairly good though is still a step down from the previous two titles. It&#39;s probably the main saving grace of the game considering that the repetitive main gameplay loop relies on so much combat wherever you go. There&#39;s also a surprisingly functional stealth system included with the game as well.    The main problem with Mafia III is that the VAST majority of what it gives to you as its core gameplay is the exact same as the boring cleanup activities you&#39;d do in any other open world game when you&#39;re working your way to 100%. Instead of being fun main missions or interesting things to do, you&#39;re stuck running from place to place to place quickly doing something and moving to the next one. Despite having a wealth of collectibles already in the game, the actual missions the game tasks you with feel like even more collecting, making the overall product a horrible slog that I can&#39;t find enough redeeming qualities in to make any sort of recommendation.

Pretty big dissapointment for me as a fan of Mafia series. Mafia 1 stands as the best Mafia game in my opinion, followed by Mafia 2. Third installment is easily the worst. Unfortunately... Unstable framerate, bugs, average graphics, awful skybox, shallow and repetitive gameplay. One thing i need to give to Mafia 3 is superb story and outstanding voice-acting/lipsync.   5/10  (Recommendation: Buy it at lower price, if you wanna go through the story yourself. Something like 20/25 €)

The game is fun to play, however, i have following concerns  1. FPS is still a problem after update, it comes to 35 - 40 from 60 at any point of time 2. Bikes or Bicycles not available in the game 3. Gameplay is almost same all the time 4. Textures are not sharp and blur is a a problem 5. Story is very confusing  Mafia 2 was much better

Day 1/2 Patch - Uncapped FPS from 30fps, but the game is poorly optimized and doesn&#39;t even keep 60fps no matter what settings you try..  4 Weeks later - &#39;Free Outfit DLC and New Patch&#39;   Free Outfits?? Mafia 2 had a good selection of clothing / outfits did you like forget to look at your previous game? Or did you think people wouldn&#39;t care to get a game with &#39;Free Roam&#39; but nothing to do in it at all?...  A lot of people are reporting that the game still performs very poorly with the new patch.  Side Notes -   Missions are very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very repetative  (did you see what I did there? lul)   Game randomly froze for me on the first mission, I had to work around a certain spot on the map to avoid the game crashing on me..

Should have known is how best to some it up.   Basically we hoped for the best. Got some where just short of mediocre. Every Mission is the same, sometimes even the same part of the map again and again. Story is ok but same over and over.  Needs some thing to mix it up or a better conection with the characters.  Mafia, in its day great game and still one of the better modern/realistic storys around.  Mafia 2 good in its day, shame about the content that was left out in the release, story missions were a bit short but was an ok game to play.   Mafia 3, to me was only saved by the music. For an RPG, there is no way to customise your clothes through the game. Cant customise vehicles. This sort of thing is &#39;Coming&#39; aparently.   The game is an incomlete mess really. Then why the ♥♥♥♥ was it released and not delayed until complete and functional?

Amazing game with a moving story and that feeling of sadness when the story is over. BUT so many bugs. and a few can be game breaking, progress halting, and pulling you away from the fun of the game with a bit of resentment. Most bugs can be fixed with just restarting from your previous checkpoint. BBBBBUUUUUUTTTT another common bug is when you try to go back and use that previous checkpoint, the game will throw you into an endless loading screen. Amazing game. I want everyone to play it. But i wouldnt want my worst enemy to have to endure the bugs that i did.   I HIGHLY RECOMMEND GETTING THIS GAME ON SALE

First off, the fps lock at this game makes it a bit rough to play when being used to 60+ fps. The game runs pretty smooth but then the game starts to get random blotches that looks like it&#39;s in the game but it&#39;s a bug that covers appears everywhere.  Second, the lip syncing is awful. I kept losing sound repeattedly and I had to keep restarting the game for the voices to even match up. At one point, the voice sounds were so low, that turning up the speakers to max would only allow you to hear it in the distance.  Third, the game is just too easy. The AI is pretty bad. If there are two people speaking to another, just whistle and one will come to you, take him out and whistle for the other. It was kind of a joke after finding out how bad the AI was. I, even, shot everyone and got wanted. All you have to do is run in the bathroom of the store and the police would eventually call off the search.  I would not recommend this game. The sound doesn&#39;t bother me too much but with the game on being too easy, at least make it look good. The game doesn&#39;t look good at the same time it feels clunky. FPS locked at 30fps while I&#39;m running 2x Nvidia 980ti.

A few months ago No Man’s Sky sold like hotcakes despite the game being nothing like it was promised. Now Mafia III is 2K’s fastest selling game despite being released in a deplorable state and with no fixing patches in sight, proving once again that in this industry everything that is advertised well will sell. Despite its numerous problems, there is a lot to like about this game, but keep in mind that it demands serious compromises to be fully enjoyed. Something must have gone really wrong at some point in the development and it can be seen in the discrepancy in quality of the game’s content. I’m no fan of conspiracy theories, but I’m inclined to believe the rumor that there was some external meddling that tempered with the developer’s creativity. In the end, like the fans of this series, the story of Lincoln Clay deserves a better Mafia game, but I don’t regret that I’ve seen this story even if it was part of an extremely flawed game.   Pros: + Good writing and excellent storytelling + Awesome characters + Impeccable voice acting + A great selection of 60s music + Satisfying shooting + Improved driving  Cons: - Missions design is repetitive - Grindy story progression - Average graphics at best - Poor performance - Questionable AI - A ton of bugs and visual glitches  Read the full review at:  http://thegameslashers.blogspot.ro/2016/11/mafia-iii-review.html

So, as of this review I have played 1.8 hours of the game and I must say I am dissapointed.   After reading all the reviews, the possitive and negative, I wanted to see for my self what really is the status of the game, and if any of the negative reviews hold any merrit.   For starters, I had an audio bug that no matter how many restarts, and surround sound checks just seemed to not go away. I checked my audio with other games and no issues but for some reason Mafia III left me unable to either hear none or barely any dialogue. This was dialoge from cut scenes and from driving in cars. (pasenger audio). If I was on foot, I would hear audio when I would look in the vicinity of where the character was speaking, and as I looked away it became a distant quiet whisper and eventually nothing. Same applied to some car sounds, police sirens, and police radios.   I kept pushing through my play having to resort to the subtittles to gleam what was going on in the story which was quite frustrating.   Second from the audio but perhaps the most imersion breaking was that characters/vehicles on certain streets seemed to float one inch off the ground. The people nad the vehicles where like floating on one inch of air. This was quite imersion breaking and was just horrible. Now seemed to be more the brick tiled streets than the asphalt ones.   I did not experience any issues with lag, graphics or any of that. I did experience alot of cliping. It was a total clip fest, and if at any point your character ran into an npc that was on a designated walking path, your character would walk right through them. Verry odd.   The game mechanics of the combat and the shooting seemed fun. I turned off auto aim and that made shooting people in certain parts of their body more entertaining albeit you tend to miss alot more at further away targets as the cross hair circle is huge at anything further than 36 yards.   I might give this game another try after bugs are ironed out and the game is polished or dare I say finished but as of right now this seems like a product that was rushed, released before it was ready just to make it out the door before the bigger tittles coming this season.   Hope this helps those of you on the fence.

One of the dullest games I&#39;ve played for a long, long time.  There&#39;s nothing interesting about this game, it&#39;s very much a GTA clone that offers nothing new or exciting. After a promosing intro sequence which actually felt a lot like Mafia, it turns into a constant rinse and repeat cycle of the same missions over and over again.  Nothing about this game reminds me of Mafia 2, other than perhaps Vito being it it as a completely throwaway character, what happened to all the things like fueling your car up? Or changing the plates after being wanted? These quirks are what made Mafia 2 such a good game but they&#39;re entirely absent here. Even the option to change your outfit is omitted despite the fact that there are shops that you can walk inside of in the gameworld, essentially they serve no purpose what-so-ever.   I wish I realised how poor this game was before the chance to refund it expired. This is an average and lifeless Grand Theft Auto clone and the worst follow-up I could have envisioned. Save your money until its dirt cheap.

game gets better with time but still not worth the price, maybe after a couple updates   i dont think they play tested this game for pc im starting to put this on steam  they continue to let these companies sell games through them that are not pc ready its really starting to be like what sears did in the 80s &#39;let anyone sell a game who cares if it works. we will offer refunds to people who give up in less then 2 hours. that way all fair&#39; not a real quote  the last three games i bought were console games that were not ready for pc, and two hours is not enough time to tell if rpg sucks.  whats wrong: key binding to non-default will cause a crash, binding anything to B will crash it immediately, other binds will causes problems later.  the 30fps thing that is fix now was just dumb  the aim is terrible, if you play with aim assist on the bullets hit but usally in the body, aim assist off and shot will go where ever. there seems to be very few hit boxes, head shots always hit same spot.  update: after a while there is a lvl-up that increases accuracy of aim. seems kinda dumb when clay was special ops in veitnam.  the ai is just dumb. i know its hard to program, but this is bad cops dont pull you over they just shoot you. there is no progression from smal crime to big crime. it is very easy to evade police.  unlike other mafia games police do not care about traffic infrations.  the story is bad and i think they knew this that is why everything is a flash back, or some asshat having to explain it from the future.  some are proud of the way the racism is used. it seems to be a joke to me. cops call player names as they walk by, but dont pull over a black guy in a corvette.   there is one scene where the player breaks up a drug packing house and all the workers are the same mostly naked woman.   this game may be fun for kids playing on there console, it is not a game for pc players

Start of the game was fantastic, but it feels like they ran out of time and had to release it unfinished. Most of the game is quite identical and will get on your nerves unless you&#39;re stubborn enough to go through it like me. In my opinion however the cuscenes, music and &#39;boss&#39; missions makes it all worth it.  The main game is quite similar to the old Godfather 2 game, but with some different mechanics but slightly less variation.  You raid mobster operations, kill enforcers and such over and over again with a few but far between special missions and bosses which are entirely unique with their own cutscenes and levels/maps.  What shines the most in the game are the cutscenes, they are fantastic and explains the main parts of the story and character interactions. Not only this but the also really nailed the music.  There was a lack of customization when the game was released but they have recently added some new features like outfit customization.  Pro: - Cutscenes, beautiful and really well done. Sadly a bit lack of cutscenes mid game. - Music, fits the game perfectly and is one of the reasons you endure the huge amount of driving in the game. - Vito, he&#39;s back and he&#39;s as badass as ever. - Missions, while the majority of the game is rather identical, the special missions and bosses are really fun and unique.  Con: - Lack of variety, doing the same thing over and over and over again takes its toll on your mental health. - Bugs, have had the cops interrupt in the middle of a cutscene, shooting holes in me as the cutscene was rolling. - Rushed, lacking in some content that should have been included in the game from the start.  All in all, I enjoyed it and would recommend to grab it at a sale. You can always refund it if you dislike it.

After 26 hours: meh. It&#39;s not bad. It&#39;s just not good.   Performance: for me, personally, it&#39;s fine. It looks OK; water is very well done, some sunsets / rises look really good, lighting is solid without being anything new or exciting. Excessive glare from some lighting is annoying, but tolerable. The whole 30fps thing was a non-issue for me, so I&#39;ll stay out of that debate.   Story: starts well, (actually, started really well); deteriorates quickly until you soon realise you&#39;re playing Saints Row San Andreas Assassin&#39;s Creed 11: The Quest for More Money. This is a shameless cash grab, that becomes &#39;Drive to marked point, turn off irritating pop-up &#39;tip&#39;, kill everything conveniently marked in red, drive away&#39; - which is really sad. It lacks innovation, polish and passion; it&#39;s just a rehash of every other &#39;open world&#39; game you&#39;ve played in the last several years. Frankly, I&#39;m waiting for zombies to arrive: it&#39;s that derivative.   Music is really good, if you like 60&#39;s / 70&#39;s tunes, you&#39;ll be in heaven here. GREAT soundtrack. Not enough to redeem it, though, but really goes to show just how good this setting could&#39;ve been.   It&#39;s just so... joyless. It&#39;s paint by numbers, without Bob Ross&#39;s soothing tones. It&#39;s just... bleh.   Case in point: physically wire-tapping a phone box marks enemies, magazines and electronic items on your map. Really? This is the level of design and innovation in AAA games now? Rehashing a mechanic that makes no diegetic sense for the simple sake of convenience.  Grab it on sale. Maybe. If you&#39;re bored. Really bored.

I was having fun with Mafia 3 before the patch even though it was locked to 30fps. I thought the patch would be a welcomed update because you could change the fps from 30 to 60 or unlocked but once I installed it I knew that this game had a long way to go. My pc is more than capable of handling this game at 60fps at max settings (I even turn aa to low in this game to reduce the blur) but yet it barely climbs over 35fps. So I changed the Reflection to low and it bumps up to 45-50fps. That 45-50fps isn&#39;t consistent either because it jumps all the time, so I changed everything to medium keeping reflection and aa at low and it makes it to 64fps but dips to the low 40s. So I changed everything to LOW. Now you would think the fps would be a very consistent 60. NOPE. the fps goes from the highest i saw 70 fps, to still 45fps. So i decided to lock the fps at 30 and play at ultra turning off aa and reflections to low. But that isn&#39;t even the most annoying thing yet. My game crashed twice, first time was from about an 1hr playing time I paused the game and unpaused it froze and crashed. Second time was when I went to shoot a box i clicked to shoot and boom CRASHED the game. I really want to enjoy this game which for the most part i was but then the game just ain&#39;t optimised and crashes so for now I&#39;m saying POSITIVE for gameplay when it works and NEGATIVE for poor optimisation and crashes. 2k pls call Ubisoft, they want Assassin&#39;s Creed Unity back!

This is another great example of a developer releasing an unfinished game, releasing patches the day after launch, announcing DLC on an unfinished game. When will we stop supporting this rediculous practice. Why wont the UK/USA govt pass a law preventing these scammers from ripping us off. This game will never be finished, just like every other game 2K ever released. The story line is cool but the game play is pure trash. Physics are worse than the lego game for babies and the vehicles drive worse than gta 1. Dont buy this game for more than $15, wait for a sale in a year or so, or even better, take your money and spend it on a condom for the next time you get f***ed by a developer

Hello,  personally i dont like this game. I was playing Mafia from the start but this part has nothing to do with the Mafia i know. It is more like a GTA with a Mafia-Mod. The Story doesnt allow you many options and is also not very boring. &#39; You killed my family, i kill you&#39; Especially with this Racing and Customization Add-On it is nothing more like a cheap GTA copy.  I am really dissapointed and think for thos who loved the other Parts this will be also kinda strange. There is absolutely no Mafia-Feeling at all.  Regards

If you like repetitive gameplay from beginning to end, this is your game! It should have stayed at 2K Czech... Mafia II was a GOTY and an award winning masterpiece compared to this bullsht.

This title is very repetitive. You pretty much do the same thing about 20x. However, the story was somewhat good. The track list is amazing. I just wished there were more channels and tracks. I personally encountered two crashes throughout my playthrough. I also seen a few minor graphic bugs and glitches. Botton line as the game stands now. I cannot make a recommendation. For sure get it during a sale but not worth full price.

Another AAA game where the PC (launch) version is a complete mess. I wish I could tell you how the game looks and plays, but I can&#39;t even get that far.  I have a 3440x1440 monitor (Acer Predator X34), the game even recognise the resolution, but everything&#39;s out of whack.  The initial loading screen is mangled. The &#39;Set display edges&#39; screen was unworkable; I got through it by [ENTER]-ing blindly a couple of times. Once the start screen is up I go to the options ... options screen shows but there&#39;s no mouse cursor and I can&#39;t access any of the four options ... AND I CAN&#39;T GET OUT OF THAT SCREEN ... I have to use TaskManager!  I tried to post this review, but I couldn&#39;t yet because I hadn&#39;t spend the minimum of 5 minutes with the game (fair enough). So I started the game, waited, and quit ... but the game didn&#39;t quit ... a hanged black screen ... so even her I needed Taskmanager to quit the &#39;game&#39;.  Refund it is then.

Today&#39;s Review: Mafia 3  Overview: My original thoughts about this game were very clear. First i know this could not match Mafia 1 and even less Mafia 2 (one of the best games i&#39;ve ever played) but to turn the game into this? first the plot, the story is unconvincing, the gameplay is pretty much ok also the graphics are pretty nice and the soundtrack is amazing, but despite that the game is really shallow and repetitive and overall i&#39;m gonna talk about 2k Shady way of doing bussiness lately.  Story: Mafia 3 sets in a fictional place called New Bordeaux (New Orleans), for Mafia 2 was Empire Bay (New York) and for Mafia 1 was Chicago. You play as Lincoln Clay, a boy raised by the black mob, orphan that at it&#39;s adult age joins the vietnam war and recieves the training to be a soldier, acording to the game a really good one, there&#39;s a minor spoiler here but everyone knows, after meeting Vito Scaletta (protagonist of Mafia 2) you get betrayed by Marconi and left to die in a fire, the game starts on a journey for revenge upon the man that took the only family Lincoln ever had, now the story itself is &#39;good&#39; not like mafia good but somehow decent.  Missions: This is where the games gets wrong, missions are repetitive and you will find yourself doing the same stuff over and over again, even killing the bosses is the same, honestly this part is what kills Mafia 3.  Gameplay: Game had several problems at launch and earned most of its bad reviews for having 30 fps look, which today is unnaceptable, after a few patches things got cleared out and the game is working properly now, overall really fluid, cars handling is very good, combat and cover system works and it&#39;s fun to play, you also get your friends to help you out providing ammo, weapons, upgrades, etc (for a price)  Soundtrack: Amazing as always, even it was the winner of this year 2016 Golden Joystick Awards for it&#39;s amazing soundtrack featuring some of the best songs of the 60 and 70&#39;s, gunfire and voice acting is really good, i&#39;ll saying extremely good, lipsyncing also is great.  Cutscenes: The best part of the game, this game nails this perfectly by delivering even better dialog and cutscenes that even L.A. Noire, everything is really well made and deserves to be commended by it.  Now you might be thinking &#39;If i like this game so much, why i&#39;m giving it a bad review&#39;, well that&#39;s because 2k decided to join other shady companies and start false adversiting the game, claiming that the steam reviews are wrong and Mafia 3 is the fastests best selling games of the last years, even claiming that their games is underdevilered, saying that mafia 3 is one of the best games of all times and everyone that thinks different is wrong, this game have a BIG flaw, it&#39;s NOT A MAFIA GAME, missions are repetivie and you find yourself doing the same stuff for the rest of the game, it&#39;s fun at first but 60 dollars is a lot of money for something like this, honestly i cannot recommend this game, not now or ever.  Score: 41/100 &#39;decent enough if you wait 1 month and get it for half the price or less, pretty much like battleborn (19.67 dollars 3 months after release at a price that i pay 59.99)&#39;

buggy with missions gone missing, having invisible buildings and boat for the mission, this game has been released as a mess this is a fail as a pc game.  the story i will say is engaging and the graphics from what i saw are par - sub par, The driving in simulation mode made me feel like i was driving in real life and the gun fights were well made that shooting down enemies felt simple.  however i find this gameplay to be way to boring i was not engaged in combat as much and i felt like it was just doing like the same objective with a different person and item.  i can not recommend this game until it is fixed and even then you will have gameplay feel like a chore  story-10/10 Graphics-6/10 gameplay-3.5/10 that is how i rate this game and the poor gameplay for my experience is why i can not reccomend this game

Do NOT buy this game if you were a fan of the previous iterations of Mafia. This game drags the franchise through the mud and spits on it. Gameplay is fun for about 15 hours, even though it&#39;s repetitive as hell. At first it all sounds logical, you meet your three underbosses assign their first districts and then it starts to sink through. You open the map and see a bunch of districts and you count in your head and then you say to yourself: even though the gun play feels really good and the driving is fun and easy there is simply too little to do in this world. Shops have literally no use other than giving you some extra money. Lincoln is some kind of super human of unmatched strength, because he one-punch knocks-out every pedestrian he comes across. The AI is a complete joke, calling that an AI is an offense.  I&#39;ve unlocked three additional districts to the first three you have to unlock to get your underbosses. And tbh: I won&#39;t finish this game. The gameplay is too repetitive and the story not entertaining enough for me to endure this nonsense any longer.  Mafia 3 is an unfinished product and I regret buying the season pass beforehand and this game in general. I&#39;m really sad and disappointed, I was awaiting a master piecer after 6 years. But what we get is not what we deserve. Shame on you Hangar13, shame on you 2K.

I was a huge fan of Mafia II and was really looking forward to the sequel. Sadly it&#39;s a huge let down.  The only good things about Mafia III are probably the music, cutscenes and the story. But even following the story, you just get bored from doing the super repetitive missions.  For an open world game it&#39;s pretty shallow. There&#39;s literally nothing to do except the boring missions (kill that guy, destroy this stuff). I wish there was some customization, minigames and so on.  For the technical side: the game runs really bad, it&#39;s sadly not supporting SLI either. (Playing on 1440p with 2x 980 TI, settings on medium, no AA, can&#39;t hit above 45fps in the city). The graphics and looks of the game are a huge let down aswell. Textures look bad, really bad. And the weird effect (or filter) is really annoying except for in the cutscenes.

  This review is mainly meant for those who have played Mafia II before and want to buy the sequel, Mafia III. Please do keep in mind that I did not come from a blank point of view as I loved Mafia II. Thanks.     TL:DR : Do not waste your money on this game, but buy the prequel Mafia II instead since it features a better storyline, more interaction with the open world and much more eye to detail overall.

No.   If you&#39;re looking for an empire building game, don&#39;t buy Mafia 3. Your wannabe crime syndicate consists of &#39;partners&#39;, which will provide you with some kickback and favors - that&#39;s it. No big mansion. No goons. Nothing. Your partners even send you around to do the dirty work for them. Dirty work includes getting trucks, ships, and cars to a racket. Rinse and repeat. Repetition is an enormous flaw of this game. Although the world is pretty big, you&#39;ll be visiting the same locations repeatedly. It&#39;s just terribly boring.  You don&#39;t seem to be able to have a personal car, upgrade your accomodations, change your appearance, etc. Hell, you don&#39;t even have a garage.   The cops seem to be blind. You can pass red lights, cause a massive car crash 20 meters infront of them, overtake them with full speed: nothing. Zero ♥♥♥♥s given. But stand next to them for too long, not even looking at them, they&#39;ll come crashing down on you.  Stealth/Melee Kills is a joke. You can simply walk around and kill everyone in a single room without getting any heat.   And then there&#39;s the collectibles. If you&#39;re a completionist like me, you will hate this game so, so much. The collectibles are scattered all over the place - and there are so many. In order to get them, most of the times you&#39;ll have to break into buildings, which are totally empty and seem only to exist to make the collectible less accessible. PRO TIP: You can kick down doors. I found out only after half way into the game.   You&#39;ll be spending most of your time driving around. Driving is super easy as compared to Mafia 2. I&#39;ve been driving on simulation mode since the very beginning. What makes driving hard are immovable objects like bushes. Bushes will wreck your car and health bar, it&#39;s ridiculous.   Despite all the hate, there are a few good things. Story is great, although I have trouble keeping up with all the different characters. The setting is awesome and it seems that the designers have put alot of effort into building an authentic world. The character animations in the cut scenes are fantastic. The animations are so good, you could actually read their lips and know what they&#39;re saying and in what mood. Oh, the soundtrack is great too. But you know what? Just buy the OST, and you&#39;ll probably have the best part of the game.   I&#39;ve been expecting way more from a game with such a considerable price tag. I&#39;ll finish the story, but after that it&#39;s going straight to the shelf.  Update: Finished the game. Ending was - as the whole game - disappointing. There are three possible endings, which all result from the final choice you get to make. Are you the person who likes to explore all different endings in a game? So am I. But I was so fed up with this game, I didn&#39;t even bother making different choices. So, so sad.

The video is not good enough to require the overhead required to play the game. It looks like a game that was coded for a different platform, and shimmed to PC. (my opinion only, might not be true) I am getting tired of purchasing games that are released unfinished, and let the paying public &#39;Beta Test&#39; it for them. There are 100&#39;s of millions of dollars at stake, and they pawn this crap on us. This is a good enough game for PS4 and XBox, but the graphics are not to contemporary standards for the PC. Let this one slide for a couple of months, and then see how much it is at Xmas time, after they have patched the crap out of it, and your video card company has figured out how to make this garbage code work on their product. AND TO ALL YOU JERKS that had a pre-copy from the company and posted those cool vids on Youtube promoting a game that you knew had issues and didn&#39;t say anything,....shame on you,...you sold out the people that keep your sorry site alive. Karma is going to f@#k you good for that one laddie. You will never get out of your Mom&#39;s basement by acting like that.

Just like the news media cant trust the big game deveopFukers period.  Every one of them is setting this standard to F*ck the gamer/consumer and release a half finished game and in turn laugh all the way to the bank, there is no such thing as to release a decent product any more.  Save your 60 bucks not worth it. This game is so friggin Buggy, glitched out, in that it crashes a lot, it ruins even wanting to play. Pobabably why you could not get 60 FPS from it, now we have 60 FPS but an unplayable game.  They washed out textures at an attempt to make it look like the 60&#39;s but in reality another big corperate wh*re game developer cutting corners and releasing a game before its time.   Npc&#39;s repeat the same two/three lines, when walking around in town to the point it ruins emersion and becomes robotic like they are not even real people. NPC&#39;s that you do engage with in combat, have little to no AI, and the pathing is not broken,not polished.The game does look better when you implement EMB, but again crashing so much it is not worth playing. EMB or Not.

Pros: Story Cinematics Music Shoot/cover/stealth mechanic is decent  Cons: Very demanding on hardware, but looks dated Lightning varies from good to horrible Pedestrian reactions to crashes are non existent, flip a civilian car over and he just pops out and goes on his merry way Killed someone in the middle of a party, half people runs, half continues dancing. Mafioso 2 meters away stays facing the other way.  If you can look past the dated visuals, have a beast computer, and don&#39;t interact with the world too much it&#39;s a decent shooter with a decent story and repetetive missions so far (12 hrs in)  I&#39;d give it a 5/10 mehs.  If they patch the performance and/or visuals i&#39;d add a meh or two.

I love the Mafia series, and I especially love Mafia III. Runs well, smooth combat, and the story is very well written. It feels as though it is sorta bland at the end of the story, but this game has many directions to go with as with DLC&#39;s and add-ons later on!  Also, don&#39;t be an OCD freak like me and hunt down every single fuse.   10/10

So far with the time I have played the game for, I&#39;m loving it. For me I&#39;m not someone who gets hung up on graphics so I&#39;ll skip it, The story is great. It&#39;s movie like. The voice acting is great and I actually care for the characters. I see Lincoln as a very badass protaganist and one of the most memorable main characters I&#39;ve played in the last few years. All of that aside, if you are looking to buy this I would recommend you wait about a month until they patch this game fully up. If you can&#39;t wait then you might as well just buy it.

I use to own this game, but then I refunded and bought Shadow Warrior 2 instead. A wise decision!   I really had high hopes for Mafia III.. but it felt off and just looked far too dated; plus the 30 FPS issue... this had console port written all over it. It&#39;s as if the developers and/or 2K didn&#39;t care. Which is a complete shame. The silver king is now that I own SW2 I&#39;ll have enough leftover to add onto for Dishonored 2!

If you are a straight guy or lesbian woman i guess the plus are the Playboy magazines and Vargas paintings?  Story is good and so is the soundtrack.  That&#39;s basically it.

Early buyers getting punched in the face again and are &#39;guinea pigs&#39; for an unfinished game, _again_. And then the game companies complain about the shrinking pc market and pirated games. I don&#39;t get it. If this game does not turn out nearly as good as Mafia II, when I am able to play it, I have lost faith in yet another publisher/game devloper.

I&#39;m trying really hard to like this title and thats a problem. Its obviouse a lot of work went into it. I would consider it a work of art but I wasn&#39;t shopping for art. I&#39;m an ancient gamer being all old and such. The only thing I could compare this title to is Dragons Lair and old movie based arcade title from the 1980&#39;s. Yes I am the Gangster Dirk Daring pushing a few buttons in between long tedious cut scenes. They would have been better off making a movie, the story line is very engaging. I&#39;m watching it every week on Cinemax with the series Quary. This title fails to peak the interest of my inner gangster. You see I want to be the gangster not watch someone else do it.

I kept my cool whilst the 60fps-racket was going, I mean they patched it after a short while. The story in itself is alright, but as I progressed through the game I found it increasingly difficult to oversee the obvious shortcomings of this game. My biggest irk, is the length required to complete it. I used 30 hours, and A LOT of this was pure repetition. I feel like Obi Wan yelling angrily to Anakin at the end of ep3, where he was supposed to bring balance! ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥it, I had such high hopes for this after the fallacy of Mafia II. But alas, my hope crumbled. For shame!

My first review on steam I think.  Im a huge fan of the first Mafia game. It is one of those few games I played from the beginning to the end many times. The second Mafia game had a very nice story, but gameplay wise already felt it was missing something the first one did perfect. Still a very enjoyable game though. And then, we got the third version. I tried my best not to watch any trailers or gameplay videos and thankfully succeded in this. Therefore the hype only got to me in the week of release. I have all the gameplatforms at home, so doubted for a long time for which platform I wanted to buy the game. At the one hand, console is easy plug and play, but on the other hand the PC ususally has more graphical options. Then there was the issue of Mafia 2 having problems on the PC. But I decided to take the risk.  First: The PC version is really not good. I have a moderate PC (it was really high end a year or two ago), with two R9 290X cards and a decent i7 processor. This PC runs most games at high or ultra settings on 60 fps, but has problems running Mafia 3 at 30 fps at normal settings. And then it still does not really look nice. There is something with the graphics that makes the game look really....off.... somehow. Next to the peformance issues, I came across quite some bugs with cars driving with open doors, cars sinking through the ground, and other strange things.  The gameplay of mafia 3 is really average. The gunplay is nice, with every weapon feeling a bit different and a nice selection of weapons to pick from. I went with the silent approach in the missions, and the silenced weapons really helped with that. Other than the gunplay, there is really not much to it. Sneaking is quite easy, with really easy enemies, you can pull towards you one by one with a wistle. And if you do happen to screw up, you just shoot your way through the end of the mission with no real penalty.  The driving is decent, but with lack of traffic rules you had in the first two games, there is no real challenge. Where I started the game driving nice with the rest of the traffice, I soon turned to high speed racing throught the city with no concequences. The cool thing about the previous mafia games was that you could get pulled over for speeding or hitting other traffic.   Then the story. This is the one thing where I liked the previous maffia games the best. The story of those games were wonderfull, and I have really good memories to them till this day. I have to say that I like the old italian mafia setting of those games a lot. The setting of mafia 3 did not really apeal to me, except for the music in that era. But, when i started Mafia 3, I really like the way they told the story. It had a really nice movie kind of story telling, with good looking cut scenes and a well thought off plot development. however, halfway of the game this story started to go to the background and the repetative mission structure got the upperhand. They got back to the story to the end of the game, but it never really got to me anymore. Then there is the srange way of putting choises in the story. You conquer districts of the city and have to give these to one of your three luitanents. I tried to keep everyone happy till the end, which I was able to do. So there was not really a lot of options in that area. Then, at the end of the story, they suddenly put in three or so choices which decide the outcome of this story. Somehow, this feels kinda rushed. They developed the main character quite well, you know why he does what he is doing, end then suddenly you have to make the choice of who he is and what he is gonna do. Feels strange.   All in all im dissapointed with this game. The mafia franchise is really dear to me. And this game is just not living up to the series. I enjoyed it, but it is really not a top notch game.   ps: sorry for my English, not my first language.

The game runs like ♥♥♥♥. The beginning was really promising with awesome cutscenes and story. That&#39;s when I decided not to refund even at a 30FPS lock cause the game ran well indoors.  After the prologue the game turns into a repetitive mess with barely any cinematics at all. My i5-6600K @4.6GHz and my GTX 1080 OC&#39;ed can&#39;t even run this game at a decent framerate. Indoors it&#39;s usually ~30-60 with constant dips to the point of nausea. Outside driving or running around it usually stays at ~30-40 with any combination of settings with the same random framerate dips. It has weird stutters and the game looks nowhere near what the screenshots show even with a pretty well mandatory reshade I&#39;m using.  This game should be set as early access and I&#39;m finding it hard to even keep playing to get my money out of it with how badly it runs and looks. Save yourself some money, buy Mafia 2 and enjoy that instead.

I must admit. I was really looking forward to this game. I even preordered it. And when I came out, I didn&#39;t even had time to play it the first few days.  And when I finally had the time to play it. Oh boy, was I disappointed.  First of, the game is barely playable at this stage. It crashed every 30 min. or so, and at times, the game can&#39;t even start back up, until you do some idiotic unneeded tweaking.  But when that&#39;s said. The story is amazing, the graphics is alright, but not top class AAA-title awardable. The atmosphere is exeptionally good. The scenery fits the time period, and driving through the beautiful 60&#39;s Bayou is soothing, especially while listening to some old time 60&#39;s rock classics.  But even though the game looks and sounds amazing, there&#39;s a few flaws which makes me dislike the game more, than I like it. The crashing is one of them. Second is the 30 FPS lock. I got a quite high end computer, and I even got problems running this game full optimized. Got a few lag spikes, graphic glitches and so on.  The lighting in this game is very poorly done. If the sun shines in a specific way on a specific object, all objects around become all white, and the reflections looks like a plastic back with water in it. It&#39;s really bad.  I have to lower my ambient oclussion just to make the lighting and reflection look just alittle like normal, but it doesn&#39;t help much. Only a tiny bit.  Also the third installment of Mafia (which has absolutely nothing to do which Mafia), is missing some huge key components, which made Mafia 1 and 2 great and much different from other open world games. The fuel-system, has been removed, which was an at times irritating part of the game, but still made the Mafia games different from others.  The cop-system has also been removed. In the first two Mafia games, you would get police tailing you, if you ran a red light, or drove too fast. In Mafia 3, they do not even bother to look at you, when you drive past them at 200mph, while running a red light. I guess that was normal in the 60&#39;s.......  And lastly... Knowing this is a 3rd-gen game, you would think that vehicle would deshape, when driving into things... Nope. Cars are hard as rocks apparently. Glass shatter, and the cars burst in flames, when damaged enough. But that&#39;s it.  There&#39;s absolutely no deformation of the cars, not even a little bump in the car doors. It&#39;s ridicously lazy of the developers.  Mafia 3 has been in development for so long, and they come out with a game, that worse than it&#39;s 12 year old predecessor.. Really... Hangar 13, you have let this fan, and many others down!  Shame on you. Shame on you for taking your fans money, and giving us this ball of bullcrap. :( I&#39;m dissapointed in you.   TL:DR Pros: Good graphics, amazing soundtrack and music, beautiful scenery, great story. Cons: Crashes, graphical glitches, repetitive missions, and a nerve wrecking 30 FPS lock (even on high-end computers), lots of missing elements (which made the Mafia-games different).

Good charachters and a good sound track do not make up for what is essentialy a game made up of repeating side missions.  It starts off so well but as soon as you are past the initial mission and the resulting betrayal (the basis of the story) its boring. the same missions over, and over and over again. Drive here kill this guy/interogate this guy/steal this map/destroy this crate. That is literaly the variation in &#39;story chapters&#39; It&#39;s a shame really as this game has so much potential. its just let down by lazy repetitive game play.   This game needs more in the way of story missions!

How to correct a name of this game in 5 steps:  1) Chose a correct name. There is some possibilities:  - Not a Mafia 3  - Bug Life 3  - Meh 3 2) Right click on shorcut of &#39;Mafia 3&#39; at the desktop and rename it. 3) Copy/write one of the correct names from step 1. 4) Press enter to apply 5) Done.

No... Just no... Got a refund for this crap. Releasing a game with such obvious issues that should have been picked up during quality testing is not ok in 2016. There is no excuse when we are paying almost 4 times the amount of money than compared to a blu ray movie... There is no excuse for releasing unfinished games. And accepting that its ok is going to produce more games with issues in the future. So im taking a hard stance now. To all you developers thinking your product is finished?? Check it again... Cause if you release it and its got a dumb issue that should have been picked up I will refund that crap before you can say &#39;My game companies going broke&#39;.  I will not be ripped off any longer...

Doesn&#39;t perform very well on PC. Disappointing, repetitive, follows the exact same mission template from start to finish. The first 5 hours were really fun, then it all just went down the drain. Interrogate informators, kill minor goons, damage comodities, kill racket boss, repeat, kill district boss, repeat X times until you reach the end (oh, and you don&#39;t even get to kill the guy yourself, you get a cutscene middlefinger). Cliché story, zero interesting twists, practically non-existent character development, no car/character customization, graphics are also pretty bad on ultra+poorly optimalized.

I played the first hour of the game so far. The game already hard crash to desktop while loading after a cut-scene. Not a great way to start the game. I still look forward to play the game and its story. But if you are on the fence, you might be better of waiting until they patch the game a few more times.

It&#39;s a great mess. Thats the best way to describe Mafia III. It has an amazing story but bland and repetitive gameplay and an unfinshed feel. The steam controller support for this game is horrendous, and the button prompts don&#39;t even show up in game. And I have had many annoying glitches and bugs. I also got quite bored about half way through the story, and overall lost my drive to complete it.

What initially drew me in with the Mafia series was the story. Instead of GTA&#39;s cartoonish satire, the original 2002 Mafia had a gripping plot with unseen of levels of characterization for an open-world game. Mafia 2 took eight years to get released and was, perhaps predictably, a letdown. Mafia 3, unfortunately, does not buck the trend.  While the Louisiana-flavored setting of the game is great and the gameplay mechanics are solid, the story and mission design leave a lot to be desired. The first few hours set the scene beautifully and it felt like the ride ahead was going to be great, but Mafia 3 very quickly became a serious grind. The main missions started to resemble throwaway side missions of better games - cut&amp;amp;paste jobs that had exactly the same goals every single time and played exactly the same every time.  I needed to take a lot of breaks while playing because the repetition numbs you very quickly. I stubbornly plowed through the checkpoints in pursuit of the small story nuggets, hoping they&#39;d eventually amount to something bigger, but the only thing that grew was my frustration, blossoming into full-blown boredom towards the end.  It&#39;s a real shame, because technically, there&#39;s not much to harp about: The game looks very nice. The sound design is great. The soundtrack is great too (although a bit limited). The systems work. But tying the story to the gameplay fails almost completely. Or maybe it&#39;s just the wrong kind of story for this kind of game. It feels hollow; soulless. It&#39;s a row of checkboxes on a form. A spreadsheet. A story that could only hope to work in a computer game medium, and even there, it doesn&#39;t.  Will I recommend the game even though I finished it? No, not really. It&#39;s not that the game is bad, it&#39;s just painfully mediocre. If you badly need a diversion, Mafia 3 is far from the worst choice you could make. But it&#39;s equally far from the best possible choice.

I am not quite sure whether I like or dislike this game. First of all, mafia 3 is neither mafia 1 nor mafia 2, it&#39;s more like a gta 5 in a different time, with less features, more ubisoft collect-a-likes and much more stereotypes.   I miss the great story from mafia 1 and the great characters from mafia 2. At least the gameplay and gunplay is really good, but this is definitely not enough!   Usually I would say this game is just medicore at it&#39;s best. If you loved the old mafias you will lose your motivation to play on quite fast. Very disapointing I really enjoyed the begin of the game, but the absence of story bothered me to much.   P.S. On top of that, this game is a big party of bugs :D

In it&#39;s current form, I wouldn&#39;t recommend Mafia 3. It has the potential but a lot of bugs, especially with the cop spawning and spotting. Light and visual glitches don&#39;t effect the gameplay, just annoying but hopefully they can fix it. The Aiming system could use some work as well as the damage to enemies since you have to either headshot them or shoot them 10 times to kill them which is annoying since they&#39;ll still shoot you with high accuracy while being shot. Story line is amazing though which is why it can be a great game if they fix the bugs/glitches in it. Hopefully they do this before they release DLC.

I do like the story line but in all honestly I hate the gameplay.  Damage on cars it seems is non exsistant until the car blows up in your face. e.g. Your going 105 mph and you crash into someone, you lose a tad of heatlh. Rev into a lampost from a standstill, the car ignites into flames. Charecter movement is very wooden and glitchy, when I tell the charecter to take cover, it glicthes between taking cover and running into an object. AI is predictable and largely seems to be on rails. The gameplay is very repetitive and always seems to be the same, Mission structure is basically go to X, kill Z, steal Y. This game doesnt even compare to its predocessor Mafia 2. Really want to enjoy this game, Im forcing myself to play it to the end. Verdict: Disapointing gameplay, really expected more from 2k and Rockstar. In my opinion they could have done alot better. Really enjoying the storyline but i dont know if thats enough merit buying the game.

As most of us, I bought mafia III with visions of shooting gangsters in my head. While the shooting gangsters part was true there where many things left out or unpolished in the experience.  Let&#39;s break this down one section at a time.  TL;DR at the end  Missions: Easilly the games weakest point. Now we all expect a game like this to have lots of shooting, that&#39;s not the issue. The problem is after playing through one or two rackets the originality of missions is practically gone. The missions break down as follows: Get information from this guy, Steal X, Kill these guys, destroy X, kill/capture this guy. Infact after playing through the entire game I can only remember one mission being somewhat different. There is a stealth option to let you mix things up, more on that later. However I will say that most of the missions never feel like you are diverting from lincols goal. Every missions having a place a long the way to kill Sal.  Side missions: Some of the side missions are where things get more interesting, such as hunting down vito&#39;s hitlist. However these missions are just about as bland. The only saving grace being the conversations with the underbosses. These make the characters come to life more and give you a feeling of being closer to them. One of the very few occurances for the underbosses in the game.  Other things to do: There isn&#39;t much beyond collectables. You also can&#39;t use your money for anything but weapons, supplies and upgrades. So you not only never change your cloths throughout the game but you don&#39;t do anything else. No getting yourself a new suit, upgrading your car (all car upgrades are passive to cars in your garage), new paintjob, getting a bite to eat to regen your health. Infact you don&#39;t even use your money to bribe anyone. This destroys the whole mafia illusion simply changing the story to a revenge plot with the mafia bit being a side line.  Gameplay: One of the most satisfying things to do in Mafia III is shoot people. Unlike most games they will react to bullets hitting them, their bodies moving from the impact and shear pain of a bullet going through them. Most enemies don&#39;t feel like bullet sponges. Now onto the stealth. The game offers a stealth option. I will say that stealth can be good fun but it is still unpolished. For example if one enemy sees you there is a good chance even a bullet in what you think is in time would stop everyone from being alerted. The AI is also rather dumb with stealth. During the game one of your goals is to make enough money to afford taking out Sal. However the only thing you can ever spend this money on is upgrades to lincoln, guns/gun upgrades, car upgrades. The enemies in the game also never get harder which makes most of the guns pointless. You could pick out the two weapons you like using the most and get through the game. I used the silenced m1n1 and the blackburn pistol through the majority of the game with no problems.   The weapon veriaty itself is also lacking. Many weapons only being slightly worse then the next or whole guns being rendered pointless by them being so close there is no point. Infact one of the supposed &#39;best&#39; pistols the clipper.44 is a reward from burke. This gun is actually worse then one I can buy earlier one and for cheaper (unless the clipper was given to you). Shotguns are also dissapointing. Enemies will get knocked back by them but not only do they fire slowly they also have a much shorter effective range then actual shotguns. Unless you are up close and personal they won&#39;t help you.   Story/characters: The game shines it&#39;s brightest with it&#39;s story and expertly voice acted cut scenes. Through these cutscenes the characters and game come to life in a way gameplay doesn&#39;t. Not just story wise but also graphically, which is a bit of a shame, would love to have seen the whole game look as good as the cutscenes. The way the game tells it&#39;s story through a documentary style fashion is a nice touch.  The characters themselves are good, except for some cliches such as clay&#39;s quest for vengance changing him into more of a two dimensional protagonist.  Setting: It&#39;s obvious the devs spent alot of time recreating a 1960&#39;s new orleans type feel. Every part of the game feels authentic to the time period, even down to the uncensored racial slurs. This I have to commend them for, making a game with this kind of commitment in a world where people seem to always find something to complain about.  Glitches: In one word, ragdoll. Enemies will sometimes get stuck in a sitting position after death, with nothing holding them up. My favorite is when I pull a freshly knifed enemy to the side to chuck him and he decided being a part of the door/wall is more his style.  I will also mention there was one instance of an enemy in a car seemingly being bullet proof. Turns out when an enemy leans out the window to shoot you his hit boxes stay the same as if he was sitting in the car. Remember, aim for his ♥♥♥♥♥, apparently.  In conclusion the game had a very strong start but by the end I was left feeling unaccomplished. If I was able to return the game now, I would. While I still think it&#39;s a good game it doesn&#39;t deserve 60 dollars. Maybe 20-30 at most.  TL;DR  Good- Solid shooting, great story, fantastic setting  neutral- graphics are a bit sub-par but still looks great, about 20 hours long.  Bad- Some unfortunate glitches, bland repetative missions, weapon veriaty, money only spent on guns/upgrades

It&#39;s a great mess. Thats the best way to describe Mafia III. It has an amazing story but bland and repetitive gameplay and an unfinshed feel. The steam controller support for this game is horrendous, and the button prompts don&#39;t even show up in game. And I have had many annoying glitches and bugs. I also got quite bored about half way through the story, and overall lost my drive to complete it. Overall, It is a very good story ruined by unimaginative gameplay and terrible optimization  It is a borderline thumbs down.

I am not quite sure whether I like or dislike this game. First of all, mafia 3 is neither mafia 1 nor mafia 2, it&#39;s more like a gta 5 in a different time, with less features, more ubisoft collect-a-likes and much more stereotypes.   I miss the great story from mafia 1 and the great characters from mafia 2. At least the gameplay and gunplay is really good, but this is definitely not enough!   Usually I would say this game is just medicore at it&#39;s best. If you loved the old mafias you will lose your motivation to play on quite fast. Very disapointing I really enjoyed the begin of the game, but the absence of story bothered me to much.   P.S. On top of that, this game is a big party of bugs :D

I do like the story line but in all honestly I hate the gameplay.  Damage on cars it seems is non exsistant until the car blows up in your face. e.g. Your going 105 mph and you crash into someone, you lose a tad of heatlh. Rev into a lampost from a standstill, the car ignites into flames. Charecter movement is very wooden and glitchy, when I tell the charecter to take cover, it glicthes between taking cover and running into an object. AI is predictable and largely seems to be on rails. The gameplay is very repetitive and always seems to be the same, Mission structure is basically go to X, kill Z, steal Y. This game doesnt even compare to its predocessor Mafia 2. Really want to enjoy this game, Im forcing myself to play it to the end. Verdict: Disapointing gameplay, really expected more from 2k and Rockstar. In my opinion they could have done alot better. Really enjoying the storyline but i dont know if thats enough merit buying the game.

I was and still am huge fan of Mafia series, started with Mafia and for ages waited Mafia II. And when it was released it was something epic. Unfortunately this time its not the case. The only thing this game keeps to other series is great story. But this time story is just video insert during game, while missions are repetitive and boring &#39;grab&#39; or &#39;kill&#39; and even though it has massive map, all of this repeats in each district. Actually if you played DLC jimmy&#39;s vendetta on Mafia II- it compares to it very well. But Jimmy&#39;s vendetta was only DLC and now it is a game. I know Mafia II had complains about not beeing open world enough, but this time it feels like it was done sacrificing game itself.  Even graphics and physics are not realistic anymore (which for me made Mafia II incredible). This time there are no small nicks and knacks that makes game stand out from other series. For me Mafia was always trumping GTA series. Not this time. It feels like copy of GTA actually. Especially when they show some gang arriving in three cars. the physics. the looks. the moves. everything is different and seems unnatural compared to Mafia II.   So all in all I would say that if you played and enjoyed Mafia series in past- I don&#39;t recommend buying it for that. You will be disappointed. BUT if old Mafia series seemed too slow paced for you or you loved GTA series and you prefer action over details - you probably will like this game.

Gameplay is cut &amp;amp; paste from every generic open-world game that has come out in the last five years. Swap out the gameplay with Mad Max, The Division, or any other mediocre disappointment that&#39;s been billed out to useless developers.  Story is decent, but nothing worth your time, and the gameplay isn&#39;t related to the events in the cutscenes most of the time. Complete enough fluff to meet the fluff-threshold and then you get a cutscene about how you killed the guy you&#39;re about to kill, spoiling it literally minutes before you go to a place where you&#39;ve just been, to fight guards that have just respawned, to kill the guy like in the cutscene.  Recommendation: Watch the cutscenes on Youtube, you&#39;re not missing anything in the gameplay.  Better Recommendation: Save yourself the time of watching all of that. Play the first hour of the game and then return it. When the main charcter goes &#39;I&#39;m going to kill the bad guy&#39; you&#39;ve reached the end of the story. It doesn&#39;t get any more, or less, complex. Main character decides to kill the bad guy. Main character kills the bad guy. Game over. No twists, no obstacles of note, no betrayal. Everything goes exactly as planned and the bad guy gets killed. The end.  P.S.: I really liked the part where it crashed during the last cutscene. Really built the suspense, having to go through the last mission again, sit through the credits again, and then sit through the credits for a third time before it let me quit.  Score: 9/11

I regret my purchase. Only 5 hours or so in, I didn&#39;t find much fun in this, because of the repetitive missions. I couldn&#39;t find myself to care much for the characters, because they kept going on-and-on about how Lincoln (the main character) is so bad ♥♥♥... and I just roll my eyes when every scene keeps repeating this. The PC controls could use some tweaking, because it always feel like their is a half second delay before performing the action I want.

Im not quite sure if i should give this a positive review or not, i feel like im slighty going towards the negative side.  My game does run smoothly ( apart from the 30 fps ) - and i&#39;ve played for a reasonable amount of time in these 2 days.   I feel like the game is very dull - clear the rackets - kill the underbosses - kill the boss - repeat. Apart from the little side quest here and there, its very linear. The driving is nothing special, the game is also very easy ( even on the hardest difficulty ) However, the story telling is very well done, as are the cinematics, its one of the few reasons i still play. I did just rage quit because i jumped down a 1 story building thinking i&#39;d survive, i mean, even in real life you wouldnt even sprain anything... but in this game, i died while on full health..so dont jump off anything at all...  So far i had a better time playing The Godfather series....  + Story  + Cinematics  +/- Shooting - Driving - AI  - Grinding ( why do they always have to include so many collectables in every game? Isnt the game long enough? ) - Dying while jumping off a 4 meter tall building  I had high hopes for this game, so far its a let down. I recommend waiting untill its on sale.

I have loved the mafia games since playing the first one as a kid. So I really want to like this game, despite the porty feel to it, the bad optimization in cities, the awful cqc system compared to mafia 2 and the fps cap that will likely be fixed.   The game looks promising so far , but im stuck on the first mission. I changed my controls so F is my cqc button (standard). This meant that i shuffled q to be my cover button and ctrl to be sneak. Long story short this broke the game.   Now not only can&#39;t I kill people with cqc, but the button to close the tips pop up doesn&#39;t work so I can&#39;t progress. I tried changing it back but it didnt fix it. So yea im stuck unable to progress until they can fix this poor excuse of a port. :/  ***EDIT***  They fixed the keyboard mapping glitch that stopped me from progressing but now I have gotten to the rest of the game, and I understand why they left the 30fps cap. My fps hovers around 20-30 fps on unlimited. Even on high the game still looks like crap. I don&#39;t know how this is possible. Why is this game such a downgrade from Mafia 2?   The people in charge of characters and story good job. Everything else is poo. Stealth is stupid easy because the ai is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. The missions are really copy paste so far and hard to enjoy when even on the hardest difficulty just dicking around I havent died once in 6 hrs.  Sad day. Wait for a lot of patches.  ***EDIT 2***  I tried to get a refund for the game because I don&#39;t see it as playable at this time. Steam denied me because I played 5 hrs 44 min, which is over their 2 hr limit. Most of that time I spent trying to fix this broken game. I have never asked for a refund before but forcing me to pay for a game that doesnt work, that I should have been able to enjoy, is not bright.

 tl;dr Don&#39;t buy it at this time.   This is a game I&#39;ve been waiting for, for a very long time. Ever since Mafia 2 was released, I&#39;ve been waiting for the next one. Mafia 1 was my favourite game when I was younger. It&#39;s what really got me into gaming. After the, in my opinion, somewhat anti-climatic ending of Mafia 2, I was really looking forward to see if 2K could add another great game to the series.  Now it&#39;s here. And it&#39;s... it&#39;s not a Mafia game. It just doesn&#39;t feel like Mafia. It feels like the developers have played a little too much GTA, and decided to make a copy of it. I&#39;ve played a lot of the previous Mafia games, as I&#39;m sure plenty of you have as well. I&#39;ve completed the first Mafia game 5 times, Mafia 2 once on normal, and then thrice on hard. With Mafia 3, I doubt I&#39;ll play it more than once. At the time of writing this, I&#39;ve played roughly 9 hours. It&#39;s been out for 24 hours exactly, and I feel &#39;meh&#39; about playing more. When Mafia 2 was released, I had completed it two days later. It was just that good. I&#39;ll probably finish Mafia 3 this comming weekend, I have enough trust in my inner geek. I just don&#39;t really want to play it...  Below is a short list of reason to buy it, as well as a list of reasons not to.   Reason to buy the game:    -The story, so far, is good. It&#39;s not on the same levels as the previous Mafia games, but it&#39;s solid.    -The music. Just like Mafia 2, the developers have implemented the actual music from this time period, making the game feel more immersive.    -The gun combat. My god. I&#39;ve played plenty of shooting games. But this games shooting just feels so damn satisfying. Unloading a clip into en enemy, seeing him fall back, or maybe over a railing, while your gun is smoking... it&#39;s just so good.    Reasons not to buy the game:   (Note: many of these things are technical, and can be resolved with patches.) -The graphics. This is, disappointingly, quite clearly a console port. The graphics just aren&#39;t good. For a PC game in this day and age, the graphics are simply not good enough.    -The driving. What happened here? Compared to Mafia 2, the driving in this game is just strange. It seems Lincoln only know two modes; brake or foot to the floor. You go form sitting at a red light, to trying to take off like a drag racer. Theres also no speed limiter. At first I thought this would be really annoying, seeing how cops enforce the speed limit in this game, just like the previous ones. But I&#39;ve yet to have any cops chase me for going too quick. To test this i drove past a police car going 100 mph, and they didn&#39;t even bother chasing me.    -The AI. While there is games that do this worse, the AI could use some work.    -And ofcourse, what every other review is also stating. The FPS lock... It&#39;s not acceptable, and is, for me, reason enough not to buy the game.   While the above are there to help you make a decision about buying the game, there are a few things I would have thought would be nice to know before I bought it.   -Cut scenes, with ingame models, sometimes have strange animations and lighting.-The map is not as big as you might think. Driving from one end to the other takes very little time. It  feels  around the same size as Mafia 2.-It feels more like a GTA game, than it does a Mafia game.  The game is over all pretty okay. It&#39;s nothing like the previous games. I think the developers took a little too much inspiration from GTA 5, and forgot they were making a Mafia game.   I, personally, disagree with the time period they chose. Or atleast the way they did it. If we weren&#39;t an outsider, taking down the Mafia, maybe it would&#39;ve worked better. In my opinion, there would have been better periods to depict in a Mafia game.  I&#39;ve never written a review before, but I hope this helped you make the decision. Whether you end up buying the game or not, I hope I was of some help.

I&#39;m not entirely sure how they&#39;re able to get away with selling this game alongside gameplay videos and screenshots that are in no way representative of the end product. It&#39;s not just the 30 FPS, the graphics are extremely MUDDY and low resolution. Turning certain graphical features OFF actually makes the graphics improve, which makes me wonder if this is the developers first time working with a PC after a career developing slot machines for the app store. Gameplay so far is a mixed bag too, in trying to make a true open world game this time around, the missions and objectives have less flavour to them. The AI is very clunky and stilted and moves predictably meaning you&#39;re rarely in any real danger. I have enjoyed the driving physics so far, the muscle cars in particular drift in a satisfying way, and the in-car combat system works well. I&#39;m hoping further patches will help improve this - not just FPS, but fixing the AA and increasing the texture resolution so that it matches the screen resolution.

Mafia 3 tells the story of Lincoln Clay, an ex-military war veteran who returns home to find his city mixed up in a mess involving major crime organisations.   The game begins with mixed missions but as you go on you realise you are doing the same things repeatedly. When I began the game, I planned to compete the &#39;story missions&#39; and the &#39;optional chapters&#39;, however, as I continued to play I realised that If i continued this I would be too bored to finished the game so I stuck to story missions.   The graphics in this game are exceptional and impress, the game optimisation on the other hand is another story. Despite having a high-end computer mafia 3 struggles to reach the 50fps mark. At times, it will between 60 and 100 but this is a rear occurrence. However, if you don&#39;t mind the low frames the game is very pleasing to look at.   The story involves killing many underbosses before reaching the main boss. It involves taking over districts and then assigning them to your chosen partners. It is safe to say this game is the most repetitive game I&#39;ve ever played. The only mission type is killing. You are tasked with interrogating, killing, killing to get money and killing to get either drugs or other items.   The game currently lacks basic features which I think should have been incorporated into the game in the beginning. Firstly, there should be much better character optimisation. A choice of about 10 outfits is a poor effort. Secondly, the creators did not incorporate very much vehicle modifications besides the basics (speed upgrade, bulletproof tyres). You are not given a set vehicle; you can call Vito and get a choice of 9 cars every time you need one (for free). As for the money, you collect, it&#39;s pointless. Most of the guns once unlocked can be equipped for free making money pointless besides for buying grenades, Molotov’s or for character or vehicle upgrades. The &#39;adrenaline&#39; is also pointless because most missions have more than one first aid cabinets.   One of the major plusses about this game is the fact that the character development is very good. I felt very engaged with Lincoln Clay&#39;s character. Some of the cut scenes are good but some of them are repetitive.  The game would be worth between £10 and £15 depending on how determined you are to complete the game. I’ve reached 23 hours (at the time of this review) and have killed every underboss. But I don’t have the drive to continue.

I don&#39;t usually do reviews, and I&#39;d honestly like to play more of this game before I make one, but I legit can&#39;t. So far, after 25 minutes of playing, my game has crashed 4 times, yes, 4 times. Not sure how I&#39;m supposed to review a game that can&#39;t even last through 6 and a half minutes of play time. Do not buy this game, at least not right now. This is just a terribly done PC port. It doesn&#39;t run properly, crashes constantly, and it has a 30fps lock.

Not much of the classic Mafia vibe left, and the new direction doesn&#39;t speak to me although I can feel the message about racism they wanted to deliver. For what it&#39;s worth the acting seems well done but it can&#39;t save it for me. This game&#39;s PC release is a perfect example of why pre-ordering is bad. Poor performance even on high-end rigs, massively broken at times (just look it up on YouTube) and essential things like fast-travel for let&#39;s say controlled districts are missing from the game. Other &#39;necessary&#39; options like re-assigning districts are missing too, although a maybe understandable design choice. Even tiniest issues like other-region keyboards being properly supported (on a German keyboard the game will tell me to press Y when it should be Z and vice versa) will not get fixed. No option to disable auto-centering of the camera while driving. Even such long time after release the poor performance and unfixed major bugs make this a horrible game to have bought. Instead of fixes we get skins. Highly doubt the release of more DLC is going to make me reinstall the game again unless some major patches get released as well. (if you made it this far you probably should have read a different review, I&#39;m not good at this and just doing it for the Autumn sale rewards lol)

This game is a slap on the face for pc players. I was a fool for pre-ordering this game. If I wanted to play this ♥♥♥♥ at 30 fps I would have bought the ps4.  If the game would be locked at 30 fps then it should have been announced before. I wouldn&#39;t have bother pre-ordering or buying the game.   Producers are developers, PC is a different plaform. So, don&#39;t try to shove down what you make for console onto pc gamers. If you wanna be par across platform just make games for consoles. Don&#39;t even bother with PC games.

Not much of the classic Mafia vibe left, and the new direction doesn&#39;t speak to me although I can feel the message about racism they wanted to deliver. For what it&#39;s worth the acting seems well done but it can&#39;t save it for me. This game&#39;s PC release is a perfect example of why pre-ordering is bad. Poor performance even on high-end rigs, massively broken at times (just look it up on YouTube) and essential things like fast-travel for let&#39;s say controlled districts are missing from the game. Other &#39;necessary&#39; options like re-assigning districts are missing too, although a maybe understandable design choice. Even tiniest issues like other-region keyboards being properly supported (on a German keyboard the game will tell me to press Y when it should be Z and vice versa) will not get fixed. No option to disable auto-centering of the camera while driving. Even such long time after release the poor performance and unfixed major bugs make this a horrible game to have bought. Instead of fixes we get skins. Highly doubt the release of more DLC is going to make me reinstall the game again unless some major patches get released as well. (if you made it this far you probably should have read a different review, I&#39;m not good at this and just doing it for the Autumn sale rewards lol)

Mafia III was annouced on July 28, 2015. It is now the release date and there is a ♥♥♥♥ing 30 FPS cap?! Come on 2K this is BS. I&#39;d recommend you wait until they patch it so we get above the 30 FPS cap... I know this just sounds like a review about the frame rate but not only that my fellow Mafia fans.... THE TEXTURES LOOK LIKE DIRT   Please don&#39;t do what I did and waste your birthday money on this..  I was so hyped for this game you don&#39;t even know... To be let down like this is just depressing.   If they patch this and fix the cons I&#39;ll change my review.

Game Is not A complete pile of Trash...   But It has allot of problems. First thing is that It tries to much to be a open world map yet It fails as there&#39;s nothing to do.. No reason to fix cars or guns and cash become meaningless.. I dont see why they did not just focuse on the action more. And make it in to story scenarios.. Would worked way better.. As getting around the map get&#39;s stall really quick.. And the Broken AI and uninteresting world doesn&#39;t help it much.. Damm I got more to do in Assassin Creed games.   I don&#39;t recommend this game.. And honestly.. The only good thing is that It&#39;s satisfying to shoot people, And the story is good.. But you lose interest in to all of it. .As the missions are repedetiv.. you do the same ♥♥♥♥ the entire game.. never get anywhere.. you never become a crime boss.. Never gain any power.. you just the guy going around killing people..   And the AI is horrible.. Damm they dont flank.. they dont switch cover.. It feels like a 2013 game.. Except in graphic..Yet it feels like the game downgrade itself betwen cutscenes and actual gameplay.. Like It&#39;s trying to cheat on you.   5/10.. Mediocer game.

I loved Mafia 1 &amp;amp; 2 but boy is this a disapointment. Should not have been called Mafia 3, has next to nothing to do with the mafia, story/telling which made the other 2 games just plain sucks, graphics are bad, mini map hopeless, stealth kills are poor like the rest of the game. If it had more polish and was called something else then maybe it would be worth a look but a Mafia game this aint.   TLDR, look else where.

Mafia 3 The game is NOT optimized for PC, 30fps cap then now no gpu can do 60fps 1920x1080. The graphics is really bad in-game but the cutscenes are pretty good.  The missons are repetitive doing all the same again and again. Driving is bad if you click &#39;D&#39; the car will fly away. The gunfights are ok.

Sorry to say (write) this but I regret buying the Mafia 3.  The story and the atmosphere of New Bordeau is cool, the music and voiceacting is top notch but the graphics and the bugs are just too much...  The graphic does not look to good but I do not have a big problem with it unless it&#39;s not running smoothly - and this is bad. I have a i5 - 4590 with Asus GTX 970 and 8GB RAM so it&#39;s not PC MasterRace but still decent enough. It seems it does not matter do I use a max or min settings - the graphic always does not feel smooth, like it&#39;s loosing framerate here and there for a spilt of a second - you cannot say it freezes on you but you still know there is something funny going.  If the game will be patched and like 50% off with all future DLC it&#39;s propably worth it but when I paid the whole pirce right now I feel like I tossed my money to the mud and could just go with GTA 5.  I now understand the comments about Mafia 2 being better even after 6 years apart from this Mafia.  In current state it&#39;s a 5 out of 10 - average at best.

Wow,  Never thought I&#39;d be so disappointed with a title that I&#39;d feel the need to voice it.   IMHO the game is not ready and unplayable at this moment. It looks like the producer of the game balantly lured people into a typical honey trap - I tried playing on i7-3820@4.2ghz, 32GB Ram, GTX1070 with the game on Intel SSD 750. The game graphic-wise looks worse than old GTA titles and still glitches and smudging/blur on the screen all the time... Very very poor...:(  How do refunds work ? I played the game for a very short time and am not planning to play it again. Is there an option on Steam to do that or do I have to conact the developer/producer ?

Update: The UI issue seems to only be in the prologue. The frame dips are caused by collision issues, mostly with NPC cars crashing into or through each other and somehow ending up halfway in the floor. The NPCs are extremely buggy, especially civilians and cops driving. I&#39;ve noticed sometimes, all of the NPCs will randomly just start driving around in circles. When this happens, they all do it, not just one. The GPS is also garbage. It frequently directs you to an inaccessible route, such as through a building you can&#39;t break. Cars randomly spawn. I had one car spawn on top of mine. I had a car spawn on a road close enough that if I hadn&#39;t been extremely careful in the first place, I probably would have hit it and killed myself. The gameplay is almost decent.On hard, the combat feels almost great. The shooting, for the most part, feels sufficiently brutal, but the melee kills feel lacking. The AI is terrible, making stealth ridiculously easy. Unlike Mafia II, where there was an open world, but nothing to do but the story, Mafia III does a really good job of making the player go around the map and complete open world objectives in the manner they see fit. The game offers a lot of freedom. It seems it&#39;s an almost decent game that&#39;s completely ruined by a bad PC port.   This game is awful. Forget about the 60 fps patch. This game is a flaming pile of ♥♥♥♥ all around. It looks pretty bad, and heats my PC up even more than GTA V, even though GTA is running at 2048x1152 on relatively high settings, and this was running at 1366x768 on low. It would run perfectly fine, albeit ugly, with a steady 60 fps, then dip into 20 with frame and audio stuttering, like playing games from the early 2000s sometimes do. The keyboard controls are horrendous. No 2 actions can be bound to the same key, my extra mouse buttons are not recognized, and actions like picking up bodies are seperate from interact. Sniper scope is also seperated from the aim key. The UI overlaps, so I was supposed to time pressing e to pry open a door, but the &#39;sweet spot&#39; which indicates when I&#39;m supposed to press e is hidden underneath a text box. This game looks to be solid, underneath the technical mess that makes it unplayable. I&#39;ve already refunded my money.

After so many years of waiting it&#39;s as though they have applied a Watch Dogs feel to the game. The graphics are nice in places but even now the Illusion engine from Mafia 2 is better. It has gone incredibly towards the arcade side, and not in a good way.

They say don&#39;t buy games that aren&#39;t out yet but I was sure this would be good, if for nothing else but the story. (I loved the story of Mafia 2) Well I was wrong, what a waste of ♥♥♥♥ing money, the AI is the worst I have every seen in a game. The story seems like it would be nice but you have to take such long breaks from it to &#39;Claim&#39; districts, which gameplay is the same ♥♥♥♥ing thing over and over again. Its just too bad really, the world they crafted is quite good, but the game itself is just lacking in too many departments for 2016. They took a huge step backwards on the customization such as outfits and car modding. Not to mention the cars will be moved from where you park them when you go inside certain buildings and the cars also barely show damage when you hit things. Their is just to much immersion breaking in this game. I will say they did a few things right, such as the soundtrack and when you&#39;re moving your character around with a controller the left thumbstick does it all, push slightly forward to walk, more for running, and click in to sprint, no smashing the &#39;A&#39; button continually like some games. Thats really about it though. Bad game don&#39;t buy.

Like a lot of fans of the Mafia game I was hoping on a third run, so when they announced Mafia 3 I was so happy and could not wait to play the game.  But after running the game I was very disappointed, the game looks like they have not put any effort in at all. It looks like they have taken Mafia 2 and tried to update the graphics and failed. The graphics and sound are what you would expect from a 2006-2010 game release. The car sounds sound cheap and messy, I have no idea what the bang sound is from car and trucks as you brake and accelerate. If I was to score this mess Iout of 5 it would be 2. I would have expected this game to look alot more like GTA 5 graphices as it being a 2016 release.  Im happy I only payed £20 for this game and not 35-45 as its not worth that sort of money. If I put a price on it it would be £15.  Such a waste of a great game. Mafia 2 look alot better.  I marked as not recommended so you can make your own choice, Its playable and ok if you can look past the messy sound and texture quality,not the best version of the Mafia games.

My first review on this game was after 2 hours of gameplay, and I was really excited about it. But, after 53 hours of gameplay (I finished it only because I paid 50€ for it, and I didn&#39;t want to throw my money away), I really can&#39;t recommend this game (maybe on Christmas Sales), because it is unfinished and it&#39;s an insult to the Mafia series.  I&#39;m giving you my pros and cons list.  Pros:  - Good music.  - Cool story.  - Well made cutscenes.  - ♥♥♥♥♥♥s! (Playboy magazines)  Cons:  - A lot of graphical bugs (People flying &#39;The Exorcist&#39; style, vehicles appearing out of nowhere, etc.).  - Really repetitive gameplay. You will get bored after taking over 3 rackets, because it is just hiding and whistling and stabbing over and over again.  - Mentally challenged AI, especially the police officers. Really, New Bordeaux PD must review their recruiting policy, because the stupidest people in the city are becoming cops.  - Big map without life or credibility. The devs haven&#39;t exploited the map at all.  - Car physics is abhorrent. You can ram into a tree at 120 mph and you won&#39;t even get a scratch on your car.  - No vehicle customization. You can&#39;t do things you could do on Mafia II, like open the trunk, fix the engine, and so on.

Pretty disappointed, the whole game felt like a san andreas rip off with its colour coded districts depending on which underboss you give it to. The traffic system that they were talking about where you had to be careful about cops around was complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t I speed through red lights left and right while cops are just there looking at me and not doing anything.  Predictable and boring storyline, repetetive gameplay, no customization (upgrades dont count), boring cutscenes and a very small arsenal of guns and cars to choose from.   The game is way too short in my opinion, they tried to make the game feel longer by making you take over the whole map to progress til the end with boring cutscenes to make you feel like you accomplished something.  The only good thing i liked was the atmosphere, voice acting, driving and shooting mechanics.  All in all its a boring, repetitive and does not live up to the little hype it had

I liked Mafia, LOVED Mafia II so I was hopeful in the lead up to this game and was let down. I finished the game a month ago... gameplay was broken then, so I just mainlined it for the cutscenes. My recommendation is just watch the cutscenes on Youtube or something. Save your money and your time, its too valuable. There&#39;s no reason to play the game for the story, gameplay is just too bad to justify any price.

The first two installments were very much linear games with open world elements. It worked very well for them. And were immensely enjoyable. Mafia III on the other feels like a vastly empty open world with small missions located within it. A third of the time I&#39;m Just driving through an empty world from point a to point b. I really tried to like this game, but 10 hours in, and I regret buying a physical copy of this. It&#39;s a really sad goodbye to a favorite franchise. Don&#39;t buy it. It feels like a try hard rip-off of GTA. Nothing like the original Mafia games.

FIX THIS GAME FOR ♥♥♥♥S SAKE Performance is still very bad and there are countless bugs, some of them even game breaking..  Without the black protagonist &amp;amp; overall setting (which isn&#39;t even that creative nor fitting as a part of the Mafia franchise) this game would probably get publicly bashed for being the second worst title of 2016 after No Mans Sky. However the most annoying things missing are a Free Roam mode at the end (you wouldn&#39;t even have to add new missions, just let the players travel around freely in the world and collect those useless collectibles..) and a regular main menu, especially where you can look at your collectibles. And by the way: Why the ♥♥♥♥ are there hundreds of those electric devices scattered throughout the City if you don&#39;t even need half of them? It&#39;s basically a complete waste of time to collect all of them. I know that the publisher probably forced this specific release date and the game wasn&#39;t truly finished yet, but how long have you worked on it, Mafia 2 came out in 2010, that&#39;s six long years.. and all the bad choices of things that are/aren&#39;t included in this game can&#39;t be explained by this circumstance.  Overall this game truly is a step back from Mafia 2, either they learned nothing from community feedback or simply chose to ignore it. As a fan of the Mafia series it is not recommended to buy this game in it&#39;s current state, however it is unlikely that everything gets fixed since many bugs in Mafia 2 also never got fixed and still exist..

This game starts out very promising, seeming similar to the linear gameplay that was mafia 2 Straight foward great story with great cut scenes. After the first hour or two the game opens up becoming a sequence of repetitive uninteresting side quests in order to develop the story. The Ai was simplistic and the great police system of Mafia 2 is gone. This game seems to suffer from the we need to open the game up and fill it with ♥♥♥♥ to avoid the negative pre release publicity. It had so much potential but I can not reccomend it at a full price. Yes i got some sort of entertainment from it but would of rather i had waited for a sale
compound: 0.8644, neg: 0.072, neu: 0.79, pos: 0.139, 
Doesn&#39;t have ANY of the stuff that made Mafia 2 great. Not even the small things which could be so easy to make, such as cops ticketing you if you go too fast, trying to arrest you if you were too naughty, etc. Nope, the cops will just kill you if you ram into them like in GTA.   Can&#39;t go into various stores and buy something to drink or eat either. Nope, not even the ones that aren&#39;t segregated.   Driving physics suck.   Missions are EXTREMELY repetitive and boring. You literally do the same ♥♥♥♥ over and over.  Terribly optimized. Can&#39;t reach 60 FPS (which is a bare ♥♥♥♥ing minimum) on a GTX 1070, i5 6600K. Was even 30 FPS locked at release, that by it self is enough to give this game a red thumbs down.  Play Mafia 2, it even looks just as good as this game and is much better.

I have a GTX 1070 who can run th witcher 3 full utlra +nvidia gameworks at 60fps in 1080p.  Mafia is again a good example to a bad optimisation title as Batman.  It&#39;s totaly not acceptable to sell a game like that.  I will wait few weeks to see if they will patch the game and maybe change my evaluation. Worst case ask for a refund !  But actually I advise people to don&#39;t buy it and wait some time.  By the way the story seems really good ! Sad to wait patch to play....  2k move your ♥♥♥!

Horribly optimized and very monotonous. Don&#39;t be fooled by the two first hours. Afterwards it&#39;s just go here, do that, kill these guys, and go back. The only thing that the game really has going for itself is the story and music. But everything else is just mediocore. And well, it&#39;s just a hassle to play, no fun at all.

Mafia III... let&#39;s keep it short since the devs did not take their time with porting the game for PC decently as well!  The Bad - severe fps drops (down to 4-5) all the time - the minimum hardware demands do not make sense since my hardware is right in between min and max demands and I can&#39;t run it properly (running everything on low) - the game looks far &#39;worse&#39; than GTA 5 (it is not ugly, though), but it runs like a rusty bike - highly repetetive missions you need to accomplish to unlock story missions - the underboss system is a hit and miss. Miss: You unlock certain perks/favours from underbosses but have to pay for those anyways. I wouldn&#39;t call those a favour then. Also, there is talk of loyalty while there is no indication on how loyal your underbosses are.  [EDIT]- your decision to whom to give a district to is based on an arbitrary skill tree linked to each underboss, so you don&#39;t decide on characteristics but on what you want to get out of them. This obviously kills the whole vibe of a possible brawl between underbosses - if an enemy becomes aware of you he is simply a bullet sponge - every main boss is a bullet sponge - alternative open world missions are highly repetetive - story-supporting missions which do not contribute to the main story are all the same: interrogate that thugh to get to the other thug to kill the third thug. All. The. Time. - hard difficulty is a joke - you can just run from so many situations whithout a scratch - the AI (in the open world) is terrible: &#39;Oh, there is a body... well, probably old age!&#39; Or: &#39;I heard shots and found three dead guys. Better search for ten seconds, then let it go,... just because&#39;. Yet they know exactly where you are when throwing explosives or shooting through thickest smoke or bushes. What a joke. - enemies have deadly precision over yours - witness system: Doesn&#39;t seem to work properly during open world missions. [EDIT]- you can&#39;t, like in Mafia 2, replay your missions by choosing them from a menue. Big disappointment right there. [EDIT]- damage model of cars is not as elaborate as in games comparable to this  The Good + story missions (non-open-worlded) work great and are fun (they are linear but they function as they should!) + video clips and actors play together very well + characters are believable + music is great + the problems of racism are adressed and you as the protagonist are to do something about it + the underboss system is a hit and miss. Hit: You can call in certain favours (hit squad, operator phone shut-off, call off police) so you need to decide wisely whom to give a district to. + witness system: when people see a crime they are likely to report you. Adds tension. + different enemy types: sentry, grunt, gunner, sniper + weapons have remarkably different attributes from accuracy over mag capacity to fire rate which actually have an impact on gun fights + gun fights feel amazin due to great sounds and impactful guns, especially shotguns [EDIT]+ elaborate city with a variety of locations and territorially distinguishable landscapes [EDIT]+ I stuck to the main story and it took me about 25-27 hours. Decent.  The Verdict Shame on the developer for dishing out such an unfinished, unpolished PC version of the game. Customers pay good, hard-earned money on your product, that has been out for 21 days now. No  efficient  fix has been issued. You took a franchise which started with a masterpiece, continued with a story-strong and combat-weak Mafia II and ended in this mess. It could&#39;ve been fun if you did not count so much on open-worlded story supporting mission design, which is bound to be repetetive and if you actually postponed the release for the PC version to dish out an optimized game. You decided to go against your valued customers, take their money and only get around 50% approval rates. Deserved, in my opinion.  I can&#39;t recommend this game, especially not for Mafia lovers like me. It is like with the movies - sloppy seconds are bad. Third parts following there are almost always utter garbage.

This game is just plain bad. I had so much expectations since I loved its prequels, However this games didnt deliver any of that.  1. The game is overly repetitive. Main missions and side missions are pretty much all the same. All you gotta do is drive to different locations and do the same **** over and over again for endless hours. Level designer should be fired for doing this,  2. Game has a nice storytelling, but the story itself sucks monkey ♥♥♥.  3. A.I. of this game is probably one of the worst in recent games. All you need is a pistol w/ silencer and they will have no clue where u are. If you are expecting a gun fight like the ones you see in gang movies, you are badly mistaken. This game is more like assassin&#39;s creed style, but 100 times worse.  4. Stupid Bugs- there are tons of minor bugs that ruins game experience. and most of these bugs could be found by simple playthroughs. QA failed big time on this one.

It&#39;s not a bad game. The gameplay isn&#39;t bad; the story isn&#39;t bad. If you took the first 2 or 3 hours, stripped the next bloated 15-20 hours down to just the necessary four or five, and kept the last hour or two as-is, you&#39;d have a downright fantastic game. But as it stands, Mafia III is as repetitive as daily suburban life and it&#39;s far, far too stretched out to justify recommending. At its core, it&#39;s a ten-hour game that drags on twice as long as it has any right to. It is not engaging enough to warrant the nine separate districts that you have to go through one-by-one doing the exact same boring things until you finally get to the part where you kill the district&#39;s captain in an actually interesting mission. Oh, and it does that thing where you&#39;re not allowed to turn off tutorial prompts, so it keeps interrupting gameplay to remind you of features that you&#39;ve been using the whole game, even when you&#39;re in free-roam after the ending.

The incompetence of Hanger 13 is truly unprecedented for a AAA title. I played 30+ hours with a few crashes here and there but nothing serious. That all changed with the most recent update - the one from October 14th; it completely tanked my game. Not only can I no longer achieve a stable 60fps, I&#39;m getting blue screen crashes now. Do you know how terrible a game has to be to cause BSOD&#39;s? The absolute lack of technical talent involved in this game blows my mind. This franchise deserved so much better. I now have a season pass I&#39;ll never be able to use because I can&#39;t play the game longer than twenty minutes before my computer crashes into blue screen. The error has to do with an outdated graphics driver - I&#39;ve reinstalled the most recent Nvidia driver three times. It&#39;s definitely on the games side because, again, I played the game for nearly forty hours with only two or three crash to desktops before the most recent patch, all on the same GPU driver. They did something on their side to make the game think the driver is outdated and hard crash to blue screen. It&#39;s truly incredible how pathetic Hanger 13 is. They have no idea what they&#39;re doing over there.   Even without the hard crashes, the fact that 2K allowed this game to release in the condition it&#39;s in is audacious. It&#39;s so poorly optimized that my GTX 1070 rarely exceeds 30% usage. Before the October 14th patch, I was able to get a solid 60fps 3/4 of the time with a combination of low/medium settings but, again, the most recent patch screwed the game up so much that, even with all settings on low, I&#39;m getting dips below 30fps now and rarely even touch 60 frames. That never happened before. I don&#39;t know who they have working at Hanger 13 but they need to be banned from the industry. It&#39;s sad because, creatively, it&#39;s not a bad game. While it&#39;s certainly redundant, no other game offers this time period and attention to detail. So I have no other game to play to enjoy the 1960&#39;s, one of my favorite time periods. I also appreciate the realism and attention to detail. GTA is great and all but some of the cars are so cartoonish and the map is boring. The Mafia franchise has always been grounded in realism appose to other open world games and Mafia 3 lightly carries on that tradition. The Mafia franchise is one of my favorites so for this disgusting studio to have ruined it really chaps my ♥♥♥. I wish the guys who made Mafia 2, 2K Czech, had made this game too; they would have done it justice.   There honestly needs to be some type of commission to investigate situations like this. Studio&#39;s should be fined when they advertise a working game, only to have it be a piece of dog sh*it upon release. I&#39;m a pretty patience and understanding person - the 30fps lock didn&#39;t even bother me too long because Hanger 13 released the patch that unlocked the framerate literally the following day of the games release. So, while it wasn&#39;t a big deal, it was an indication of how terrible the game performs. And for them to release a patch that not only makes performance worse but actually tanks your game... I can&#39;t even. I&#39;m done. There&#39;s just no excuse for this level of incompetence.

It&#39;d be great if I could even get the game running but as I&#39;ve seen on several forums, it&#39;s apparently a broken game. I try to launch the game and I get the launcher then try to hit play and Boom. It doesn&#39;t launch. HUGE disappointment. I love the Mafia series but the fact that I can&#39;t even get it running when it&#39;s been out for a whole fricken month is just unacceptable. I&#39;ve tried every approach that others have recommended, making sure my drivers are properly updated, re-installing the game, restarting my computer, everything that I can think of and everything that&#39;s been suggested. This was supposed to be an anniversary gift to me and now it&#39;s been crapped on by my inability to even get it started.

Bad news is good news when making money, locked 30fps is a marketing tactic to get the word out. For example look how Apple, Nvidia, Sony launch a product they intentionally limit the first batch of a product to half or less so it&#39;s immediately sold out, This builds scarcity and value in Sheeples little minds about this product, in other words builds Hype.  However, with software publishers for gaming the marketing tactic trend is to have a broken game at launch.....

What the hell this game isn&#39;t even starting up. The little mini menu for the game pops up and I pretty start and it looks like it&#39;s about to start and than it goes black screen and than just exits back to the desktop. And for a few seconds in the steam library it says the game is running but than it stops and nothing happens. It isn&#39;t working for me. Is anyone else having this problem? if so please tell me. and if you can please tell me how to fix it if it can be fixed.

Shortly, DO NOT BUY for PC. Not up to 2016 standards. Everything maxed out and it just doesn&#39;t look good, lots of bugs and the &#39;open&#39; world is very limited. Combat is very easy and boring even on hard and sneaking is so easy that a knife is the only weapon needed is most &#39;fights&#39;. Only good thing is the story, but even that is let down by the way too easy combat...

Update: So still keeping this negative untill bugs have been fixed that said i by now have a bit better idea of the game  the good thinks: ohh those are a bit hard .. story is pretty well done the same goes for character animations, Cops are pretty hard to evade, Its definitly not a bad game it has its upsite.  the bad thinks: this one is a bit larger, Bugs are one reason, there are several i have encounterd and only once they helped me, else they f**** me over. I had several crashes on the start of a cutscene ( important story thinks i would guess) when i restarted the game i could not see them because the game automaticly jumped over this letting me wonder what just happent and how the hell did i get here. Then well there is the thinks. i expected more from the 3rd game but got way less.. its not to bad since its about the main story of the game and that is good, but its about those small thinks .. i know i could use my turn lights in the old mafia games and needed to fuel my car, you cant do this anymore they basicly removed small but cool thinks and did not realy add any new thinks. There are stores in game but beside robbing there cash register ( the owner does not mind you doing that) you cant do anything in it .. the game does not really feels like a mafia game to me.. maybe its because you are fighting the mafia but still. The worst thinkg though so far.. this game seems to be done with console in mind first not taking anygood care of the pc verions resulting in bad menu controlss ( they are pretty bad really) Car driving is .. well ♥♥♥♥ ( you cant drive with ease anymore like the old games and obay the traffic laws)     Well again the story is pretty well done but controlls are just terrible its clear this is a console port. graphics options are also pretty .. naaa bad. so is it a worth to buy? maybe .. this game is way more worth 60$ than no mans sky is but it has so many downsites right now.If they fix most of the stuff yes. if not then no. Graphics are also not impressing, its clear that this game suffers by being a cheap console port, i suspect thats also the reason why there are so many bugs and cashes right now. again the story is still well done and you have good freedom to do your missions like you like. and i like going stealth and this is pretty good possible =)    So yes you can buy it but be carefully and think this over 2-3 times about what kind of a person you are

The incompetence of Hanger 13 is truly unprecedented for a AAA title. I played 30+ hours with a few crashes here and there but nothing serious. That all changed with the most recent update - the one from October 14th; it completely tanked my game. Not only can I no longer achieve a stable 60fps, I&#39;m getting blue screen crashes now. Do you know how terrible a game has to be to cause BSOD&#39;s? The absolute lack of technical talent involved in this game blows my mind. This franchise deserved so much better. I now have a season pass I&#39;ll never be able to use because I can&#39;t play the game longer than twenty minutes before my computer crashes into blue screen. The error has to do with an outdated graphics driver - I&#39;ve reinstalled the most recent Nvidia driver three times. It&#39;s definitely on the games side because, again, I played the game for nearly forty hours with only two or three crash to desktops before the most recent patch, all on the same GPU driver.

This game is made to run in 30FPS for the console inferiors. If you unlock the 30FPS cap there is no way you are gonna reach the 60FPS in most places because they didnt care to optimize the game.  If you dont mind playing games that run like slideshows than its fine i suppose.

Author&#39;s Note: Don&#39;t judge this review by the time I&#39;ve spent on the PC version of this game. I bought it on the PC when it first came out, knowing that it probably wouldn&#39;t run on my PC, I was right. So, I decided to get it for the Xbox One. I won&#39;t really be able to cover any PC glitches or anything of that nature, but I can give you my opinion on the game. So, here we go.   After playing Mafia II, I had high hopes for this game. I heard that the story was great and that the soundtrack was amazing. Sadly though, it didn&#39;t meet my hopes.   The game is set in 1968, in the fictional city in Louisiana called &#39;New Bordeaux&#39; (Which is basically New Orleans). You play as Lincoln Clay, a man who just got back from the war in Vietnam. All&#39;s well in his life until tragedy strikes and Lincoln is out for revenge. Now, I do admit that the story is pretty darn good! It&#39;s probably the best thing going for it. If you&#39;ve played the previous game, you&#39;ll also recognize some people. The new characters are also interesting.   After the story, though, things start to get a little average. If you couldn&#39;t tell already, this game is a third person shooter, just like the rest of the series. There are a multitude of guns in your arsenal, available to purchase in-game. There&#39;s pistols, snipers, shotguns, automatic guns, and more. The shooting in this game isn&#39;t anything new, if you&#39;ve played any third person shooter, you&#39;ve probably played this one too.   Being that this is an open world game, there is also driving. Now, the cars in this game look pretty sweet, but the driving isn&#39;t anything new either. Once again, if you&#39;ve played an open world game with cars, you&#39;ve probably played this one too. The one plus with the driving is the radio. The soundtrack has some great hits from the era and do make driving worth it!   Here&#39;s where it drops more...the missions. If you&#39;ve ever read a review on this game, you probably already know this. The missions are all basically the same. You either kill someone or you destroy something...yep. When I first started, I was excited about the missions. I do admit that they&#39;re pretty fun, but they get old FAST. It came to the point where I was so lazy that I just got the sniper, drove to a vantage point, parked the car, got out, sniped the target, and drove off. You can stealth-kill targets, which can be fun, but it just gets mundane. Mission after mission of the same thing. Back in Mafia 2, missions felt more unique. Sure, you had your shoot-outs, but there were some great missions! Now, there are some unique missions, but most of your time will be spent doing the same interrogation animation 12 times, killing one fool several times, or smashing up something.   One of the goals of the game is to take over the map, and that is done by completing missions. When this is done, you can assign pieces to your three lieutenants and it&#39;s done by holding a meeting. Giving pieces of land and completing missions for any of your lieutenants can give you access to new stuff, such as weapons. Doing the missions though means more of the same stuff. Overall, I thought this system was fairly cool, but it still makes you do the same old missions.   Another thing to note is the graphics. The in-game graphics are pretty good, but sometimes seem a little lack luster. The cut scene graphics though are extremely well done and the whole thing feels like a documentary you&#39;d find on the History Channel. Also, when you&#39;re not killing targets or busting up places, there&#39;s also collectables to be had, different cars, and clothes to buy. Other than the missions, though, there&#39;s not much to do.   In the end, Mafia 3 turned out to be a decent game, due to its story, music, and amazing cut scene graphics. Mafia 3 doesn&#39;t do a good job in terms of being the next installment to Mafia 2. If you&#39;re looking to buy this, I&#39;d say wait for it to go down to $20, at the very most. $15 dollars would be more ideal though and if you&#39;re truly looking for that mafia experience, stick with the first two games.

Been broken since release, last update made the fps more stable. Recent patch broke it again. Running a i7 6700k and a gtx1070 and still drops down to 47fps!! Run games like gta5, witcher 3 at 100++ fps. And then there is this repetitive story. Meet a new client, do some damage to some people, ♥♥♥♥ off the boss, kill the boss, repeat 6-8 times and the game is done. Story in mafia 2 was great, one of my favourite games. Mafia 3 is horrible. 2k should just leave it, appologise to the fans and start over totally from scratch. Total waste of money.

I finished the game.  Each racket you take down is the same thing. You go around robbing and stealing from the boss&#39; workers and factories, causing damage. Then they get ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off, show up to the place you just robbed and you kill them.  The repetitiveness is a pretty huge downside to the game, and for that I&#39;d say keep your money.  I do strongly believe that they did an awesome job on the story telling and cut scenes.. but I&#39;m paying for a game, not a movie.

I need to get something off my chest, I cannot believe how some of you fanboys are defending this game. I understand you are trying to justify and defend your purchase but god damn, the amount of hate being thrown at others for simply stating facts that this game is abosolute ♥♥♥♥ in terms of optimizations.  To the people that don&#39;t have any issue, just because your game works DOES NOT MEAN IT DOESNT WORK FOR OTHERS.  This game was rushed, it was a ♥♥♥♥ console port and once again PC players get the long ♥♥♥♥ stuck up our ♥♥♥.   Now that they released an uncapped framerate in the latest patch the game still can&#39;t run at 60 FPS.   I have a 980 and the game can&#39;t even run it at 60 FPS at 1080p or 1440p  The graphics are ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥, low res and blurry.  The game crashes often, I played it for an hour before it crashed on me like 5 times.  The AI is dumb as ♥♥♥♥  Glitches out the ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥   Just giving some points here the game runs ♥♥♥♥ing horrible and I still cant believe people take this ♥♥♥♥, REFUND THE GAME and get your money back, its not worth waiting this poorly optimized game to get patched.   I can&#39;t believe people are like looking for mods and other ways to get the game run better, WE SHOULDN&#39;T HAVE TO DO THAT, the game should be released in great state for us so we can play and mod it later if we want to enhance the experience.  THIS IS A WARNING TO PEOPLE THINKING ABOUT GETTING THE GAME, DO NOT BUY IT IN ITS CURRENT STATE. THE STORY LOOKS GREAT BUT THE GAME RUNS LIKE HORSE ♥♥♥♥.  SEND A MESSAGE WITH YOUR WALLET, PC PLAYERS DO NOT DESERVE THIS CRAP ANYMORE.

So far, first patch weekend after release, I&#39;m expericing more issues than pre-patch. Suddenly getting a lot of hitching on my reasonably high end PC.  Frame rates don&#39;t bother me, but I&#39;d rather it ran smoothly at 30 than all over the place at unlimited and hitching at 60.  I am experiencing crashes too, and for a game without quick save that is a pain.  That being said the game is fun. If you liked Mafia II you will like this. The world is bigger, the voice acting is good, and it is a lot of fun to play when it works.  But if performance is valued over all else, wait to buy this. Fingers crossed a few more patches will straighten it out. So for now, I&#39;m leaving a negative review.

Mafia 3 was the game that I was the most exited to play during 2016. From the first trailer I was immediately hooked and having played Mafia 2, I knew this had to be good. Sadly, I am very disappointed at how this game has been released unfinished and broken. Here&#39;s a list of problems that are occuring in my game and I assume other&#39;s games aswell.  -horrible AI (both enemies and civilians) -very strange looking weather effects -insane amount of pop-in for almost all textures -broken lighting effects which also ties into the weather effects -lagging like crazy even on low settings and after the fps cap patch -crashing if I move the camera around too fast   Now here&#39;s another problem that I have been experiencing that I haven&#39;t seen many other people have but if the devs so read this review please fix this weird glitch. Now when I began playing the game, everything seemed normal. Nothing odd or unusual (aside from the list above). I was just exploring the river in a boat when I saw a boat at a dock suddenly shoot up into the air. This caused my game to crash and force my computer to have to reset itself. After this I began experiencing the same phenomenon but with cars. Some would crash the game, others would just cause me to go under around 5 fps. After doing some missions while trying to cope with these flying vehicles every so often, I noticed that at most road intersections, there would be a massive line of cars waiting for a destroyed car sitting in the middle of the intersection. Cars would sometimes just slam into these destroyed cars and eventually, blow up. The traffic AI became absolute ♥♥♥♥ after I started noticing cars driving in circles going 50 mph defying the laws of physics and glitching through walls and other objects that they weren&#39;t supposed to be clipping through and then eventually, blowing up. I am not going to play this game until the devs do something to fix the mess of a game they have on their hands at the moment. As for now, I cannot recomend this game to anyone (at least on PC) until it is fixed.

Do not, I repeat do not buy this game. If you like it pirate it, spend some time and enjoy it. Maybe sometime later when it will cost 10 euro it will be worth it. I sadly bought this game not from steam so I am stuck with it. The graphics are horrible, saints row 4 tier. (except for facial animations, those are wonderful) story is good, music is great, gunplay and some gameplay innovations like smart and agressive cops and their tactics are nice but otherall it&#39;s a horrible downgrade from mafia 2. Mafia 2 back in its day looked amazing and had an amazing engine which was pushing the boundaries. It wasn&#39;t gta IV but it was a totally different beast. More gruesome, more realistic, more... &#39;&#39;mature&#39;&#39;. Mafia 3 is just gta V but a lot worse in every possible aspect.

Play Mafia II instead. Or GTA 5. They are far more better games instead of this. Storytelling on Mafia III is excellent. Kinda like the story itself. But, experience from graphics and amount of fun by playing of this game is very limited. So your PC will perform super on MAFIA 2 on max settings. On Mafia 3 will do only the middle settings with far worse visual experience in my opinion. Both games finished on my Y50-70 laptop with i7,16Gb RAM and gtx860m

I have just logged over 20 hours in this game. I have only two more districts to take-over. I am enjoying this game. I did wait to purchase until after the first month of patches were release, so my opinion is not influenced by the early bugs. If you have a PC that meets the criteria, I say this game is worth the journey. It plays similar to GTA5. The story is great. I do recommend you also purchase the $4.99 vehicle/weapon pack if you did not pre-order... I did not pre-order, I purchased during the Steam sale, played a few hours, bought the $4.99 pack, and was glad I did in order to have a fast car (T-bird) available for car drops. My only critique is this $4.99 pack should have been part of the game. Oh well, I am loving it. I hope developers will keep supporting PC as even games with flawless releases get flogged.

Review After 12 Hours  A game with loads of potential, squandered by lack of Mission creativity, and lack of overall variety in Mission types.  Pros - Soundtrack is absolutely amazing (Jimi Hendrix, Johnny Cash, CCR) - Story is great! 1960s crime syndicate/city takeover. So great - Driving is fun, especially on simulation mode - Graphics are okay. Not great, not bad, but just &#39;Okay&#39;  Cons - Missions are repetitive as ♥♥♥♥. Break up the racketeering joint. Kill guys. interrogate Boss. Hand over District. Repeat.  (I have put 12 hours into the game, and nothing else has happened besides this. No exaggeration. That&#39;s it) - A.I is absolutely terrible. Basic last gen stuff. - Pop in is drastically bad.  - 30FPS until patch (Strange they didn&#39;t just launch with 60FPS)  I would not recommend the game at full price. If you could get it at a sale price (60% off or more) I would say try it. Still repetitive as ♥♥♥♥ though.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sKioT-DpnyM

If you have an older AMD/Intel processor, do not buy this game yet!   Does not even start on my machine: AMD Phenom X6 1090T R9 290 4GB 12GB of RAM  so when this and the 30FPS lock is fixed, i will write a new review, but for now, for god sake stay away!  UPDATE 1: The 30fps patch has released, and i have some news for you, i still didn&#39;t play a second of the game, so i don&#39;t care about performance updates!! i want to run mafia on my machine, cause it&#39;s no excuse the game does not support bla bla bla, it is the ONLY game out that has this problem!! And if the devs are so lazy to not fix this then DO NOT spend your well earned money on this piece of crap, buy Battlefeld 1 or something else.  UPDATE 2: 5.8 GB of an update, and no phenom fix...yes they focused on new clothes, rather than fixing what is broken, fixes are minor, but i can&#39;t tell what they fixed, i still cant run this exuse for a game!!

As a mafia 2 fan I feel like they just slab the name &#39;Mafia 3&#39; on this one to attract old fan, this should just be a new IP, most of the attention to details that exist in Mafia 2 are all gone! Hell you can&#39;t even flush the toilet in the game now, you can do that and other small little detail in Mafia 2, which IMO makes the game feel alive and unique.

The story is very engaging, combat/shooting flows well and is simple and satisfying.  I do like the missions so far, although they are mostly similar to a degree (Only played a couple hours) And i dont get why people are having trouble with the driving? I find it very easy and even Fun! in simulation mode.  Even before the 30 FPS Cap was removed was when I put in most of my time thus far, and I had no problem playing at this framerate, the game still flowed smoothly and was 100% playable. Of course not having a cap is better :) Just dont see all the hate!  The Only thing that bothers me (Only a little) Is the graphics, it is grainy as others have stated, and the quality is a bit lower than current AAA Games. With better video quality i would give it a perfect 10!  Rating 8/10: Buy it!  K Bye

This game does not feel OK.   Do I think that you just play this game? YES. Why not?  It&#39;s not because some of us did not like the game that you wouldn&#39;t like it either. Give it a try and if you really don&#39;t like it. Just ask papa Gaben for a refund.   I only played one hour and watched the rest on YouTube. So here is MY opinion on the game. Disclaimer: My opinion might differ from your opinion.   Graphics: 5/10. (Not the best but who really cares? I&#39;d rahter have a fun game then a good looking game. Mafia II is much better then this game but this game looks better.) Story: 2/10. (Just another boring revenge story. Nothing really suprised me. I could&#39;ve guessed the ending without even playing it.)  Problems with this game: - Bad port - Boring world with nothing to do really.  - Boring story  This game is NOT worth the price. Play some other games untill this goes on sale.   I hope my &#39;opinion&#39; was a little helpfull. But don&#39;t decide if you should buy this game based on opinions. If you have the money try it and if you don&#39;t really like it. Ask for a refund.   If you don&#39;t have the money. Don&#39;t buy this game. Lot&#39;s of more games out there that you will enjoy and maybe get it for less money.   Have a nice day.

Stay away from this game. Frame rate is horrible, it is unoptimized, gameplay is wonky and inconsistant. The only redeming quality of this game is the story and the sad part is you need to suffer for hours just to get to the minor good parts. There are no traditional missions in the game, it relies too heavily on it&#39;s psudo-open-world tasks to have the player progress. These tasks are repeated over and over again in each town district of the game. The side missions are also the same open-world tasks. This was a serious disappointment.

I love this type of game. The type of game that doesn&#39;t have limits or censorship on the realities of life. The story starts and ends satisfying, perfectly developing all of the main and side actors that you spend time with throughout the game. The reason I say actors is because of how extremely well done all of the cut scenes and ingame facial animation is in this game.   A lot of people keep saying this is a poor mans GTA, but if there is one thing this game does better... it&#39;s the over all developement, tone, feel, and immersion of the characters/story. Oh, and the shooting/soundtrack. GTA V&#39;s shooting compared to this game is definintely on the lower grade. There is a lot of special small details with the animations that make it a lot more than your usual open world shooter feel. This game&#39;s soundtrack is the best of the year, including an enourmous amount of famous and non famous musicians throughout the 50s-70s. The Beach Boys, Elvis, The Doors, Creedence Clearwater Revival, Jefferson Airplane, etc. There are too many to list in one steam review.  As you&#39;ve most likely noticed, I&#39;ve completely bypassed talking about the technical issues of this game so far. They do exist, unfortunately. My experience never lead to me not being able to experience the game to its fullest thankfully. The most inconvenient bug I ever had was having to restart a checkpoint because a NPC didn&#39;t go into its scripted path. That fixed it, though. The technical issues really just depend on your PC in the end of the day.   I have too much to say about this game... but in the end, all I really have to say is how much damn fun I had in the 29 hours it took to beat it. Thanks for creating this game devs, you guys did a fantastic job with your resources. I&#39;m looking forward to future products from you guys!

I just finished the game, and here are my throughts:  1, The story is interesting, and the cutscenes are just excellent; but they are too short and too far from one another. You better just go on youtube and watch the whole damn thing to save both money and time. 2. There are some interesting levels, but then again, they are too few in numbers and too far from one another. 3. They got the balls to include achievements that require two separeate playthroughs? As if one is not more than rnough. Also, no achievement for collecting all the magazines and posters? WTF? 4. Too many collectable TL-19 fuses. To be exact, 246 too many (yes, my OCD kicked-in a bit). What were they thinking about? 5. Graphics are pure garbage and game performance is just bad (I am rocking a GTX 1070+i7-6700 yet I cannot run 2K smooothly at 60FPS on low textures). Unless you have a controller, the inputs and UI elements are going to be terrible as well. 6. Gameplay is just repeatitive as hell; the AIs are dumb as well (I died only 9 times on hard difficulty). To be honest, I wouldn&#39;t even finish the game should it came out a few days later (cough cough Battlefield 1 cough cough).   Conclusion: Watch youtube and save both money and time. And please give those who pre-ordered the deluxe edition a moment of silence.

People are literally getting shot in the streets like dogs every day yet you choose to ♥♥♥♥♥ about a 30fps lock that was removed the day after release, because you deserve the very best of everything all the time right?!.

I had to force myself to play through this mind numbing experience. Never do you feel absorbed into the story or atmosphere. The story doesn&#39;t really make sense, as it portrays you as a mob leader running drugs and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s and robin hood at the same time. The voice acting is really good, but the number of cut scenes and fragmented story are just ughhhhss. They rely heavily on the shock value of the racist elements of the story, but it gets stale quick. The news updates on the car radio were about the only thing entertaining for me, and mildly so. Not a fun game, not a dark game. Just another follow the recipe open world GTA clone with bad controls made for the console market with a PC port.

Dispite the 30 fps lock at launch, this game is still visully stunning and have not had any problems with the graphics with my gtx 980ti.  Having 10 hours+ in the game, I can tell you that if you like a story driven game with vicious kills and savage characters, this game is for you. Apart from the amazing story in the game, It also had a vast amount of side missions, which actually help you gain abilities and perks in the game. Also the N is used like 10 times right off the bat so be warned.  Side Note: This game is the first ever to motivate me to collect collectiables ;) with their playboy magazine nudes as collectables.

I&#39;m gonna start off with saying that this game had so much potential. Lincoln Clay is an absolute badass, and his voice actor suits his hard-boiled personality perfectly. The problem is that this game is plagued with so many issues that it makes it hard to enjoy the creative story and environment.  Let&#39;s start off with pros and then proceed to talk about the cons:  Pros:   -As previously stated, this game has a lot of potential to be game of the year. The main character, story, and setting are all top notch, but the execution is awful.  -Even though game runs with 30FPS cap, the 30 FPS was smooth for me. It&#39;s definitely playable and wasn&#39;t as distracting as I thought it would be since I&#39;m used to playing games in 144 Hertz.  - Story is interesting, I&#39;m enjoying what I&#39;m seeing so far. The characters are nicely designed and voice acted, and most importantly are believable.  -Gameplay is solid. Not necessarily addicting or perfect, but solid. Most guns feel good to shoot, and Melee works well most of the time.  -Sadly the positive aspects of this game are few and far between, but one last thing I want to mention I enjoy is animations and cutscenes. The cutscenes are well acted and look graphically superb to the game. The animations are very brutal and feel good to execute.  Cons:  -Awful 21:9 support. I&#39;m playign this game on an Acer Predator X34, and the image is definitely sub par to other 21:9 games I&#39;ve played this year.  -Graphics make the game look like an HD PS2 game. It was obviously not properly supported on PC to allow player with powerful hardware to take advantage of it. It feels like a lazy console port, with absolutely no benefit of playing on PC other than the promise of a future patch for 60 FPS and unlimited frame rates. Character model faces are muddy and unclear, textures are muddy, field of view is awful, anti-aliasing has no advanced options like SSAO, MSAA, or even FXAA, just low, medium, high, textures don&#39;t even have a settign to control, meaning you&#39;re stuck with what look like console textures on a game by a huge Publisher in 2016. Overall graphic options and presentation are absolutely abysmal.  -No keyboard key remapping, meaning I had to use controller since KB&amp;amp;M controls were wonky.  -Visual glitches such as green waves covering Lincoln&#39;s face in scenes with dark shadows.  -Game crashing to desktop issue that occured for me twice in one hour, unacceptable.  Conclusion:   Had the potential to be a stellar release, but dropped the ball big time. Rushed PC port with awful visuals, unnacceptable CTD issues, and no 60FPS support at launch.  4/10 - Absolutely below average, and sadly not one of the better games of this year.

(Oct, 7th) I would wait for the post release update if I were you.  UPDATE (Oct, 8th) Nevermind the patch. It is here, it gives the game 60 frames per second but it won&#39;t save Mafia III from being one of the ugliest &#39;next&#39; gen AAA titles available. Differences between low and high setting are barely visible. And adding insult to injury, this game is BORING!  B-O-R-I-N-G.  I played the same exact gameplay a milion times before! There&#39;s absolutely nothing new here and the mission structure plays a hell lot like Assassin&#39;s Creed Syndicate (do some missions in this area; unlock the boss of the area; kill the boss; the area is now yours. RINSE AND REPEAT FOREVER!!!) which is NOT good.  Developers promise to bring races, car customizations, costumes and whatnot available (mostly) for free very soon, but, at least for me, it just doesn&#39;t make sense to not make those available at launch.

Midnight release and no crashes, no bugs, or glitches i have encountered yet. Enjoying the game so far!! Love the gunfights along with the brutal takedowns! Enjoy shooting the ppl seeing them suffering. The blood effects are nice and is satisfying when shooting someone in the head. The driving is my only downfall. Not use to the drving but im sure it we attach to me and eventually i will enjoy it. Story is amazing so far along with the people you encounter. You start to get feelings for a couple of them.. Great job at making the game actually feel like you&#39;re in new orleans.  Pros Story Graphics are nice Can choose outta 3 ppl to make underbosses Drive boats and cars Tons of weapons to use Soundtrack is nice Tons of side missions &amp;amp; collectibles  Cons Police dont mind if you speed and cops dont take your license plate  Driving feels weird graphics feel like a huge downgrade  too many bugs.

After you&#39;ve taken two Districts you&#39;ll realize that you just have to do the same thing over and over again (go there, kill/interrogate that guy). Once you&#39;ve killed/interrogated enough people in a district you can kill the districts boss.  I enjoyed the driving part of the game (on simulation mode) and the shooting is not bad. Music is also good and the city looks great.  Civilians are kinda dumb and policemen are out for you.  Game is super repetitive. I have to say I enjoyed the last mission and the KKK gathering one.  Would not recommend

Story is very immersive so far, graphics alright and takedowns brutal. The driving when switched to simulation also feels great. Only con i can think of is the 30fps cap.  Edit: We now have 30,60 and unlimited fps options and the game runs great! Got a smooth 60 fps on high settings with my 1060. Can highly recommend this game.

This is my review of Generic Open World Game 6:  Technical Stuff: Can&#39;t turn off FXAA. Screen is blurred and messy. Randomly crashes (A LOT after the patch, struggling to play with frequent crashes). Bad performance. Glitchy lighting. Terrible muggy textures.  Bad keyboard and mouse controls.  Animations are good. Voice acting is also good.  Police will never attack anybody else other than you. Because &#39;they&#39;re in the mobs pocket&#39;, which is just an excuse to say &#39;we didn&#39;t wanna code that&#39;.  As for the story, it really misses the charm of the first two games, which told a pretty serious story with finality and interesting characters. It felt like a story that was taking place within a real world. Mafia 3 seems to have gone away with that in order to accommodate their open world &#39;take over the districts&#39; gameplay, making it into another generic open world game with padded content. The side characters seem over the top in a way and it just doesn&#39;t feel like a good mafia story. It&#39;s a shame, I think, because the Mafia games really are unique. I always enjoyed how you were a grunt in the mafia machine and you weren&#39;t this force to be reckoned with, with a cliche revenge story, you were just a guy trying to be somebody, and sometimes that meant doing the grunt work. It feels like it&#39;s trying to be as appealing a game as possible, instead of the unique games that Mafia 1 and 2 were.  I don&#39;t understand how people are saying the story is &#39;amazing&#39;. It&#39;s not a bad story, but it&#39;s nothing special, just a overdone revenge plot. Every single plot point in the game is &#39;but how should we kill them all?&#39;. One dimensional and uninteresting characters. What do we learn about Lincoln Clay throughout the entire game? Nothing really. He&#39;s good at killing and that&#39;s about it. There&#39;s no reprecussion to any of his actions, police don&#39;t come after you, the mafia doesn&#39;t respond to you in any meaningful way other than saying &#39;Wow he&#39;s disrupting us&#39; in some cutscenes. Yawn.  Got bored after 6 hours, tried to power through to the end, decided it&#39;s not worth it.  See this video for more reasons why Mafia 2 is better:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixlszwKVVP0  Even if the technical problems are corrected, I still wouldn&#39;t recommend this game.

Unfortunately a great disappointment and really a &#39;what could have been&#39; type situation for this game. Not to mention yet another warning not to pre-order games especially on PC. From my small amount of play time (+ lots of youtube vids) the story looked quite solid and the cutscenes with people looked fantastic.   But for an open world game the exterior areas are just not up to scratch for a PC title in 2016. I hope that the textures, draw distance and other performance issues are improved soon and if so I may repurchase it in the future. They have a long way to go though when considering how it looks (compared to GTA V etc) and I could barely get 30 fps on high unlocked at 1440p with an i7-6700k, 32gb ram and 2x 970 GTX, which can run GTA V at 80-100 fps on max.

It&#39;s an &#39;Not Bad / Okay&#39; game.  What makes this game &#39;good&#39; is because of its storyline &amp;amp; music, Hangar 13 has made a really great job on making the storyline and also for choosing all of the voice actors. But, the game feels kinda empty (for me personally), rushed &amp;amp; repititve (like other people said), they could&#39;ve done better. I&#39;m not dissapointed on this game, I just hope they will make another sequel but learn from their mistakes.  Gameplay = 7/10 Graphics = 7/10 Storyline = 8/10  Overall = 7.3

There are good games, there are bad games, and then you have garbage.   This game belongs to the third category. It is poorly optimized and glitchy at release, even after patches the bugs persist. Only people who are good at jokes (or those who are a joke themselves) would release a game that&#39;s not completed or fully tested - and have the nerve to charge people money for it.  My graphic card gets 45-55fps on games like GTA V on 4K resolution at maxed settings. This game is not even playable at high settings on 1080p. Unless you have a GTX Titan or above, don&#39;t bother trying to get a decent framerate out of this game.

Seriously ?   Caped at 30fps ? I hope it will be fixed. Otherwise - the game (preorder) will be the same mistake as with Watchdogs etc. For that moment, poor graphics with 30fps is nothing but back to the past  I recommend to wait till everything will be patched  @edit  Patched, but sill stuttering and FPS around 60 per second (on high end machine)  Optimalization sux :(  But now its playable a little bit

This game certainly had some issues at launch, between the capped fps and the blurry rendering it was fairly hard to play. This being said the devs quickly hot fixed these issues and the game runs very smoothly now. The story is captivating and the gameplay is incredibly fluid and fun. The only draw back being is that the missions become fairly repetative after awhile, but the story is good enough to keep you entertained.

Mafia III showed promise leading from a great game that Mafia II was along with it&#39;s features including the original Mafia. It seems they have been quite lazy in developing this game although the graphics are good, not the best and the city can be visually good. All they had to do is combine Mafia and Mafia II into Mafia III along with it&#39;s features and customisation. The missions are incredibly repetitive and offer nothing new everytime, it&#39;s go here, interrogate, kill and steal over and over. I&#39;ve read that FREE DLC is coming for customisation but it should have been in the full game already. Mafia III could have been another great Mafia game but without those little features and a more solid, enjoyable mission to play it just is another game that nobody will really look back on or replay it in a hurry.
compound: 0.9513, neg: 0.064, neu: 0.77, pos: 0.166, 
Mafia III have membership in an exclusive club, where few games belong. It is one of the worst console game ports I have ever played, where the menues, the graphics and the playability is so corrupted by this bad port that i struggle to even try to complete it.   I mean, the game doesn&#39;t even recognize mouse4 and mouse5-buttons when remapping controls.  As this price, I expect a lot more than y2k/hangar 13 has managed to scrape together. It&#39;s an insult to their customers.

The storyline is great, and with a reshade installed the game looks good. But the game crashes alot and the memory allocation and optimization of the game is terrible. This is especially prevelant when you look at whats on display in the game. The game shouldn&#39;t be taxing our systems like this. I&#39;m running a GTX 1080 and the game isn&#39;t stable. The gameplay is actually fun, but its hard to get into because the game crashes every so often. It&#39;s pretty bad, and since there hasn&#39;t been an update on PC to fix the glaring problems with the game, I can&#39;t recommend anyone spend a dime on this. Save your money for a game that is actually put together properly by the developer.

Is it a bad game? No. But is it a Mafia game? Again no, all of the mafia game&#39;s mechanics have been scrapt leaving an empty shell that defines this game as just another GTA clone. PLZ fix all of those issues listed in these videos and fix the ammunition mechanics i play on hard and do not have any problem with ammunition and how the helldo i get smg ammunition from assault rifles?   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQ1YMeY07xI   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixlszwKVVP0  (I am not the creator of these videos)  So overall i would recomend buying this game once all of the problems are fixed by hangar 13 or mod support fixes them. Finally pleas stop hating on 2K they only published the game they where not the ones to make it blame hanger 13. sorry for bad English.

Its a good concept for the Mafia Series. However, with the obvious mist step with releasing this game at a &#39;peasants&#39; 30fps; it was an omen to what was to come. The game looks a lot better after the patch. However, it is very buggy, and freezing in combat or emptying an entire clip into an enemy, only to have him kill you with one shot is not my idea of fun. It seems that a AAA game would be better equipped to handle the power of PC, but this game seems to have a difficult time and likes to crash, or glitch out while playing.   Additionally, it is kind of boring. I mean after the story line is done the game just becomes mundane. I played 8 hrs. and I&#39;m done. It will now sit and collect &#39;dust&#39; until I get around to deleting the game from my SSD.

Alright, i don&#39;t write reviews mainly because a lot of issues with a title usually are explained by other reviews. However, this game is likely the most dissapointing, unrefined and downright offensive (Not due to the setting.) Game i have ever played.  For sake of simplicity, a simple pros and cons. (I see why 2k didn&#39;t release ANY real review copies, it would of been a flop before release.)  Pros: Story, although even that is a mess, Voice acting (The only thing i have no complaints with.) Cons: Everything else. No. Really.  Engine - Originally locked to 30FPS which made me avoid this title, but once i seen an update for 60 and unlimited FPS i decided i would bite the bullet due to my love of the Mafia Series. This isn&#39;t much of an issue but shows the developer knew they had a half-baked potato. Also of note is this game doesn&#39;t support SLI, and looks ABSOLUTELY HORRENDOUS on anything above 1980x1080 as the user interface is just about non existent at anything above it.  Also, there is a disgusting blur effect, even through removing motion blur in the options is covering EVERYTHING. and by everything i mean EVERYTHING. This game also has an abysmal Draw Distance and EVERYTHING and i do mean EVERYTHING &#39;Pops in&#39; and &#39;Pops out.&#39; CONSTANTLY.  Of other note also is that the game absolutely HATES you changing ANY of the default keymapping settings resulting in crashes, assigned keys not working.  Textures: This is a major offense, the facial textures in this game are actually very good, and some interior textures also look pretty good but EVERYTHING ELSE in the game looks like something out of 2008, it&#39;s not hard nor expensive nowadays to make proper textures. An especially good example of exactly how bad this is being: the skyboxes that look worse than some of the skyboxes from the Nintendo 64 / Playstation Era. It&#39;s the laziest excuse for a &#39;Sky&#39; i have ever seen. Looks more like a zebra skin texture.  Lighting: This is probably the biggest visual blunder of the bunch,and all of the other blunders are just about deal breakers. It is INCREDIBLY buggy, it glitches CONSTANTLY FLICKERING and the shadows in this game are also horrendous, the time it takes shadows to actually update to the lighting system is delayed, the lighting itself also drowns out a LOT of color from the already very sub-par textures.   And during sunset or dawn the sun produces the most blinding, eye hurting form of light i have ever experienced in a game, and i&#39;ve been gaming now for over 19 years. It&#39;s hard to explain exactly how bad it is through a video or image, it really doesn&#39;t become apparent how bad it is until you actually play it.  Physics: A little wonky, but i have to say is probably the only thing as far as gameplay that is satisfying. Although the game seems to add unrealistic, extra weight to whatever vehicle you drive. You can crash into an identicle model of car at the exact same speed an NPC is driving and the NPC&#39;s car will noticably be much more affected by physics.  Models: Very, very bad models. The hair of characters looks fake, almost plasticy. It&#39;ll make you physically say &#39;WTF&#39; on multiple occasions as you go through the game. Cars and vehicles are also noticably a huge cut below the models in Mafia 2 from 2012, and the damage system for vehicles really is pitiful, the hood of a car can come off, the front and back can get a little dented but the superb glass models and physics from Mafia 2 are completely void, &#39;Scratches&#39; in the vehicle damage system also seem to not exist. You can just about blow up your car and it looks barely any different if it was in pristine condition.  I remember in Mafia 2 just shooting a glass display out of a shop window and being impressed with the physics and breaking of glass. There isn&#39;t a single bit of astonishment here with Mafia 3. In any. Way. It looks miles behind GTA 5 or even indie titles of today. There&#39;s also a large lack of variety in enemy faces, textures and clothing.   Weapons: There&#39;s a huge lack of variance in weapons, i will say the shotguns are satisfying to use but, in the further sections of my breakdown, anything good about the weapons in this game are completely irrelevant because you WON&#39;T HAVE TO USE THEM 99% OF THE TIME.  Cover system: Noticably again, a major cut below mafia 2&#39;s. While it retains all the features of mafia 2, it is noticably more clunky and unrefined. The only positive thing they did here was include &#39;Blind Fire&#39; but really, you won&#39;t be using it much.  Vehicles: Noticably less variety of vehicles from Mafia 2, and this brings me to another shortcoming. There is little to no vehicle customization ( you can buy vehicle customizations from the arms dealer, however it doesn&#39;t have any charm, you don&#39;t drive into a car shop even although there are dozens scattered across the map and they don&#39;t have any visual impact, and very minimal gameplay impact.)  They have removed all of the realistic traffic laws and violations of Mafia 2 that gave the game a sense of being alive. Just don&#39;t hit pedestrians, put the pedal to the floor, don&#39;t hit cop cars and you will never have to barely deal with the police in any way. And gone is the need for fuel, or controlling speed, getting &#39;Hit and Run&#39; violations for hitting vehicles.  The only positive is the vehicles don&#39;t entirely drive like boats and I DO like the visual representation of where to go when you select a waypoint on the map and this game has something i&#39;de like to see in other open world games -- a WORKING REAR VIEW MIRROR. But, given the game as it is, these things i do like don&#39;t mean anything.  World Map: THERE IS NOTHING TO DO. NOTHING. Gone is the ability to stop anywhere to grab a sandwich, there aren&#39;t any extra activities, there&#39;s no rpg elements that reward you through skill progression to do things in the world. You will be going from point A to B following your mission tracker, or grabbing collectables and &#39;Fuses&#39; (more on that in a minute.) and THAT IS THE WHOLE GAME.  They have also included a direct rip of Assassins Creed&#39;s &#39;Discovery&#39; system, you need to &#39;Wiretap&#39; at given positions which costs 3 &#39;Fuses&#39; that you find in the world which reveals within a certain radius the locations of ENEMIES (you can literally see them through the walls at ANY GIVEN TIME.) Collectibles (While nice, you can tell the licenses for the collectibles and soundtracks and album covers are where most of the budget of this game went.) and the aforementioned &#39;Fuses&#39; which are nothing but a lame, uninspired way of tacking on HOURS of fetching them and calling it &#39;Gameplay.&#39; Just to wiretap some more, just to get some more collectibles and fuses.  The only thing you can spend your money on, and i really mean the ONLY things you can spend your money on are car upgrades that don&#39;t matter, and weapons, as i will explain shortly that again, don&#39;t matter at all in the slightest.  Another gripe i have is just the general lifelessness of the world. It really is lifeless. With the only wildlife being GATORS.. Seriously...?  I&#39;m running out of room for my review apparently. But the last, Story: This is a cashgrab story. There&#39;s no conclusion of what happens to joe, the pacing is STRAIGHT ACTION ALL THE TIME. You are given little actual meaningful backstory of lincoln, he might aswell be a gorilla with a knife in a cookie cutter revenge story. You meet vito along the way but even he is lacking character. The AI is so bad you can stealth kill for 13 hours straight with only needing to fire one clip of ammo. (weapons are unneeded) Also, i&#39;m experiencing a gamebreaking bug where after Burke (third racket after 13 hrs of repetitive, exactly the same missions (story and optional missions feel exactly the same, empty and dull.) where no more story missions are popping up or available. So i&#39;m essentially stuck with no way of continueing my playthrough.  In everyway this is a step backwards. SKIP, SKIP, SKIP, SKIP

This is my first no good game. This game is not finished. Do not waste your money to buy it. Do not waste your money to buy it. Do not waste your money to buy it. All the mission is just kill kill kill. Yes, it has a stealth mode, but there always put a lot of enemy in some place that you cannot avoid them in every mission. When you driving, you can see almost all the AI drivers are drunk. The stupid AI even cannot drive car along the street! They&#39;re just block all the street and makes traffic jam. The exprience is a kind of toture when you play a mission to trace a car. Because it&#39;s impossible to finish the mission since the stupid cars all along the street!  You can jump from the door side to other side without be noticed, even the enemy just stare on you. This game have too much bugs, much more beyond what I said.

Well I was really hoping and wishing strong for this game. Been the thing I&#39;ve been really waiting for for about a month, and have keeped an interested eye on it since early this year. I can say, for me, this games has a hard time running, eihter it being low or high end graphics. I don&#39;t have an issue with 30 fps since I have used a ps4 and an xb1. But this isn&#39;t even a smooth 30fps, for me. It is very blurry and jittery. Hard to play really. This game needs some major graphic cleaning, what I mean is smooth gameplay. Hopefully this update planned for this weekend will help. For me again, it is hard to play at this moment. Will hopefully recomend in the future, but now, not recomended.

Even the 60FPS patch didn&#39;t make any difference, this game has serious issues, it doesnt just need polish (which it is sorely lacking) it needs to go back into development to be fixed, and then released later when its actually in a state to be played.

WARNNING the entirety of the game play is ALL THE FLIP FLOPING THE SAME!.  It starts out so strong having good memories of older games then it hits a brick wall gooing at what the flipping flip speeds and just recycles the same sheit over and over. 4 hours in i think i realy hope this ends. NOPE 18 hours and still the same damn thing just in a new location mayeb if you get lucky its a new building layout.  Between the repetitive gameplay you get epic cutscenes with great story telling but that doesnt not make this game worth the asking price not by a flopping long shot   i havnet beaten it and i feel like i wasted money. I thought it was a no brainer to preorder... oops... i loved mafia 1 and 2 and the trailers and yes i know trailer rarely show real gameplay i just thought this was going to be a good choice to buy right away looked liek a good damn time.  Sadly i feel ripped off and cheated. and would like my money back... yeah i know i ♥♥♥♥ed my self.   2/10 whata peice of ♥♥♥♥- Dunkey-nmb

Its a good concept for the Mafia Series. However, with the obvious mist step with releasing this game at a &#39;peasants&#39; 30fps; it was an omen to what was to come. The game looks a lot better after the patch. However, it is very buggy, and freezing in combat or emptying an entire clip into an enemy, only to have him kill you with one shot is not my idea of fun. It seems that a AAA game would be better equipped to handle the power of PC, but this game seems to have a difficult time and likes to crash, or glitch out while playing.   Additionally, it is kind of boring. I mean after the story line is done the game just becomes mundane. I played 8 hrs. and I&#39;m done. It will now sit and collect &#39;dust&#39; until I get around to deleting the game from my SSD.

Alright, i don&#39;t write reviews mainly because a lot of issues with a title usually are explained by other reviews. However, this game is likely the most dissapointing, unrefined and downright offensive (Not due to the setting.) Game i have ever played.  For sake of simplicity, a simple pros and cons. (I see why 2k didn&#39;t release ANY real review copies, it would of been a flop before release.)  Pros: Story, although even that is a mess, Voice acting (The only thing i have no complaints with.) Cons: Everything else. No. Really.  Engine - Originally locked to 30FPS which made me avoid this title, but once i seen an update for 60 and unlimited FPS i decided i would bite the bullet due to my love of the Mafia Series. This isn&#39;t much of an issue but shows the developer knew they had a half-baked potato. Also of note is this game doesn&#39;t support SLI, and looks ABSOLUTELY HORRENDOUS on anything above 1980x1080 as the user interface is just about non existent at anything above it.  Also, there is a disgusting blur effect, even through removing motion blur in the options is covering EVERYTHING. and by everything i mean EVERYTHING. This game also has an abysmal Draw Distance and EVERYTHING and i do mean EVERYTHING &#39;Pops in&#39; and &#39;Pops out.&#39; CONSTANTLY.  Of other note also is that the game absolutely HATES you changing ANY of the default keymapping settings resulting in crashes, assigned keys not working.  Textures: This is a major offense, the facial textures in this game are actually very good, and some interior textures also look pretty good but EVERYTHING ELSE in the game looks like something out of 2008, it&#39;s not hard nor expensive nowadays to make proper textures. An especially good example of exactly how bad this is being: the skyboxes that look worse than some of the skyboxes from the Nintendo 64 / Playstation Era. It&#39;s the laziest excuse for a &#39;Sky&#39; i have ever seen. Looks more like a zebra skin texture.  Lighting: This is probably the biggest visual blunder of the bunch,and all of the other blunders are just about deal breakers. It is INCREDIBLY buggy, it glitches CONSTANTLY FLICKERING and the shadows in this game are also horrendous, the time it takes shadows to actually update to the lighting system is delayed, the lighting itself also drowns out a LOT of color from the already very sub-par textures.   And during sunset or dawn the sun produces the most blinding, eye hurting form of light i have ever experienced in a game, and i&#39;ve been gaming now for over 19 years. It&#39;s hard to explain exactly how bad it is through a video or image, it really doesn&#39;t become apparent how bad it is until you actually play it.  Physics: A little wonky, but i have to say is probably the only thing as far as gameplay that is satisfying. Although the game seems to add unrealistic, extra weight to whatever vehicle you drive. You can crash into an identicle model of car at the exact same speed an NPC is driving and the NPC&#39;s car will noticably be much more affected by physics.  Models: Very, very bad models. The hair of characters looks fake, almost plasticy. It&#39;ll make you physically say &#39;WTF&#39; on multiple occasions as you go through the game. Cars and vehicles are also noticably a huge cut below the models in Mafia 2 from 2012, and the damage system for vehicles really is pitiful, the hood of a car can come off, the front and back can get a little dented but the superb glass models and physics from Mafia 2 are completely void, &#39;Scratches&#39; in the vehicle damage system also seem to not exist. You can just about blow up your car and it looks barely any different if it was in pristine condition.  I remember in Mafia 2 just shooting a glass display out of a shop window and being impressed with the physics and breaking of glass. There isn&#39;t a single bit of astonishment here with Mafia 3. In any. Way. It looks miles behind GTA 5 or even indie titles of today. There&#39;s also a large lack of variety in enemy faces, textures and clothing.   Weapons: There&#39;s a huge lack of variance in weapons, i will say the shotguns are satisfying to use but, in the further sections of my breakdown, anything good about the weapons in this game are completely irrelevant because you WON&#39;T HAVE TO USE THEM 99% OF THE TIME.  Cover system: Noticably again, a major cut below mafia 2&#39;s. While it retains all the features of mafia 2, it is noticably more clunky and unrefined. The only positive thing they did here was include &#39;Blind Fire&#39; but really, you won&#39;t be using it much.  Vehicles: Noticably less variety of vehicles from Mafia 2, and this brings me to another shortcoming. There is little to no vehicle customization ( you can buy vehicle customizations from the arms dealer, however it doesn&#39;t have any charm, you don&#39;t drive into a car shop even although there are dozens scattered across the map and they don&#39;t have any visual impact, and very minimal gameplay impact.)  They have removed all of the realistic traffic laws and violations of Mafia 2 that gave the game a sense of being alive. Just don&#39;t hit pedestrians, put the pedal to the floor, don&#39;t hit cop cars and you will never have to barely deal with the police in any way. And gone is the need for fuel, or controlling speed, getting &#39;Hit and Run&#39; violations for hitting vehicles.  The only positive is the vehicles don&#39;t entirely drive like boats and I DO like the visual representation of where to go when you select a waypoint on the map and this game has something i&#39;de like to see in other open world games -- a WORKING REAR VIEW MIRROR. But, given the game as it is, these things i do like don&#39;t mean anything.  World Map: THERE IS NOTHING TO DO. NOTHING. Gone is the ability to stop anywhere to grab a sandwich, there aren&#39;t any extra activities, there&#39;s no rpg elements that reward you through skill progression to do things in the world. You will be going from point A to B following your mission tracker, or grabbing collectables and &#39;Fuses&#39; (more on that in a minute.) and THAT IS THE WHOLE GAME.  They have also included a direct rip of Assassins Creed&#39;s &#39;Discovery&#39; system, you need to &#39;Wiretap&#39; at given positions which costs 3 &#39;Fuses&#39; that you find in the world which reveals within a certain radius the locations of ENEMIES (you can literally see them through the walls at ANY GIVEN TIME.) Collectibles (While nice, you can tell the licenses for the collectibles and soundtracks and album covers are where most of the budget of this game went.) and the aforementioned &#39;Fuses&#39; which are nothing but a lame, uninspired way of tacking on HOURS of fetching them and calling it &#39;Gameplay.&#39; Just to wiretap some more, just to get some more collectibles and fuses.  The only thing you can spend your money on, and i really mean the ONLY things you can spend your money on are car upgrades that don&#39;t matter, and weapons, as i will explain shortly that again, don&#39;t matter at all in the slightest.  Another gripe i have is just the general lifelessness of the world. It really is lifeless. With the only wildlife being GATORS.. Seriously...?  I&#39;m running out of room for my review apparently. But the last, Story: This is a cashgrab story. There&#39;s no conclusion of what happens to joe, the pacing is STRAIGHT ACTION ALL THE TIME. You are given little actual meaningful backstory of lincoln, he might aswell be a gorilla with a knife in a cookie cutter revenge story. You meet vito along the way but even he is lacking character. The AI is so bad you can stealth kill for 13 hours straight with only needing to fire one clip of ammo. (weapons are unneeded) Also, i&#39;m experiencing a gamebreaking bug where after Burke (third racket after 13 hrs of repetitive, exactly the same missions (story and optional missions feel exactly the same, empty and dull.) where no more story missions are popping up or available. So i&#39;m essentially stuck with no way of continueing my playthrough.  In everyway this is a step backwards. SKIP, SKIP, SKIP, SKIP

This is my first no good game. This game is not finished. Do not waste your money to buy it. Do not waste your money to buy it. Do not waste your money to buy it. All the mission is just kill kill kill. Yes, it has a stealth mode, but there always put a lot of enemy in some place that you cannot avoid them in every mission. When you driving, you can see almost all the AI drivers are drunk. The stupid AI even cannot drive car along the street! They&#39;re just block all the street and makes traffic jam. The exprience is a kind of toture when you play a mission to trace a car. Because it&#39;s impossible to finish the mission since the stupid cars all along the street!  You can jump from the door side to other side without be noticed, even the enemy just stare on you. This game have too much bugs, much more beyond what I said.

It&#39;s good to know that they earn millions on this game but can&#39;t even get the most fundamental things to work (60 FPS i.e.).  What has happend to this industry?

I mean, I don&#39;t know, It just feels boring, I own serveral consoles so the FPS lock isn&#39;t an issue even thoe i&#39;d love to use my 144hz monitor to the fullest in Mafia III.  The game is just boring, well, yes the story is pretty solid but the things that made Mafia II so good between the story missions is missing, no character customazation what so ever, you can&#39;t really change the visuals of your car, police is a joke, in Mafia II you had to change freaking clothes to get the cop of your ♥♥♥, now you can just drive away. The world feels just so empty, i&#39;ve heard rumors of a &#39;Free DLC&#39; which would include customization for both Cars and Characters, but I won&#39;t belive it &#39;till I see it.  I would say, wait, let 2K fix their mess-ups (which I really really hope, because they usually fix stuff) then buy the game if they made the game more Mafia like.  Right now I just feel that the game is not really Mafia, it&#39;s just a bad 1960&#39;s GTA style game.  Really disappointed actually.  -CHP

Well, I&#39;ve spent roughly 9 hours in this game so far and I can not understand the 30 fps `negative hype` so far, even with 30fps locked, gameplay is fine as it is, they apparently learned a lot from previous mistakes in Mafia 2 where ye essentially didn&#39;t have anything tae dae besides the storyline, quite so the two dlc&#39;s addressed that issue a wee bit but not entirely. I like the game and now as the publishers announced tae fix the fps-issue within the next few days I&#39;m looking forward tae spend even more time in this game.

Well I was really hoping and wishing strong for this game. Been the thing I&#39;ve been really waiting for for about a month, and have keeped an interested eye on it since early this year. I can say, for me, this games has a hard time running, eihter it being low or high end graphics. I don&#39;t have an issue with 30 fps since I have used a ps4 and an xb1. But this isn&#39;t even a smooth 30fps, for me. It is very blurry and jittery. Hard to play really. This game needs some major graphic cleaning, what I mean is smooth gameplay. Hopefully this update planned for this weekend will help. For me again, it is hard to play at this moment. Will hopefully recomend in the future, but now, not recomended. ( PS, my system can run games ranging to fallout 4 to gta v to the division at 60 fps and full 1080 no problem. ) I really wish/ can&#39;t wait to recomend this game.

Before I get into the review, let me say that I love the game, but what the devs did is unforgivable.  I&#39;m not giving this game a positive review to show the devs I don&#39;t support these kinds of ports. It&#39;s sloppy and lazy. Let me go by naming a few:  -Capped 30FPS (of course I had to say it) -Really low quality textures  -Objects clip into eachother  -The view distance is tiny  -The environment in general seems blurry  -Floating bottles  -1080p is blatantly an upscaled 720p (which is the main cause of many of these problems)  -Stuttering framerate -When the game launches, it doesn&#39;t close the launcher, forcing me to go into task manager and close it because it plays music  This is unnacceptable. This shouldn&#39;t become the norm for Triple A PC Releases. This is abhorrent and ridiculous. Hangar 13, I know this is your first major game (I could be wrong), but that doesn&#39;t mean you can do this to your PC community. You know damn well that a huge amount of PC Players can run this game so much better than you&#39;re forcing the entire community to play it at. Fix it, and fix it quick. Once the patch comes out, I&#39;ll edit my review depending on what happens.  EDIT: Now that the game has been patched, the game runs better now, but it&#39;s noticably poorly optimized. Even with the low quality textures the game has, it only gets like 57 fps. It&#39;s ridiculous. Also, the only other thing they changed was the keymapping. There&#39;s still no ability to change graphical settings. You can still only change post processing. Still not recommending.  EDIT 2: After playing for over 10 hours, I think I have a rough idea of what this game is. I thought this was going to be a successor to Mafia 2, but looking back at things, Mafia 2 is eons better. This game is watered down with the same rinse and repeat missions. The main story missions are few and far between, since you have to gain control over an entire territory to unlock it. It&#39;s frustrating and makes this game burn out fast. This game should have been worked on longer. They should have added more main missions rather than the side missions you&#39;re forced to do.  EDIT 3: Well, I beat the game. Can&#39;t say I feel accomplished. Story was alright, but way too overrated. I have no interest in playing afterwards. I feel like I wasted my money and I&#39;m never getting it back. Devs released another patch that fixes blurry upscaled resolution, but it did nothing. I&#39;m done with this game, and I&#39;m not buying another game from Hangar 13; they can kiss my ♥♥♥.

Just don&#39;t hit pedestrians, put the pedal to the floor, don&#39;t hit cop cars and you will never have to barely deal with the police in any way. And gone is the need for fuel, or controlling speed, getting &#39;Hit and Run&#39; violations for hitting vehicles.  The only positive is the vehicles don&#39;t entirely drive like boats and I DO like the visual representation of where to go when you select a waypoint on the map and this game has something i&#39;de like to see in other open world games -- a WORKING REAR VIEW MIRROR. But, given the game as it is, these things i do like don&#39;t mean anything.  World Map: THERE IS NOTHING TO DO. NOTHING. Gone is the ability to stop anywhere to grab a sandwich, there aren&#39;t any extra activities, there&#39;s no rpg elements that reward you through skill progression to do things in the world. You will be going from point A to B following your mission tracker, or grabbing collectables and &#39;Fuses&#39; (more on that in a minute.) and THAT IS THE WHOLE GAME.  They have also included a direct rip of Assassins Creed&#39;s &#39;Discovery&#39; system, you need to &#39;Wiretap&#39; at given positions which costs 3 &#39;Fuses&#39; that you find in the world which reveals within a certain radius the locations of ENEMIES (you can literally see them through the walls at ANY GIVEN TIME.) Collectibles (While nice, you can tell the licenses for the collectibles and soundtracks and album covers are where most of the budget of this game went.) and the aforementioned &#39;Fuses&#39; which are nothing but a lame, uninspired way of tacking on HOURS of fetching them and calling it &#39;Gameplay.&#39; Just to wiretap some more, just to get some more collectibles and fuses.  The only thing you can spend your money on, and i really mean the ONLY things you can spend your money on are car upgrades that don&#39;t matter, and weapons, as i will explain shortly that again, don&#39;t matter at all in the slightest.  Another gripe i have is just the general lifelessness of the world. It really is lifeless. With the only wildlife being GATORS.. Seriously...?  I&#39;m running out of room for my review apparently. But the last, Story: This is a cashgrab story. There&#39;s no conclusion of what happens to joe, the pacing is STRAIGHT ACTION ALL THE TIME. You are given little actual meaningful backstory of lincoln, he might aswell be a gorilla with a knife in a cookie cutter revenge story. You meet vito along the way but even he is lacking character. The AI is so bad you can stealth kill for 13 hours straight with only needing to fire one clip of ammo. (weapons are unneeded) Also, i&#39;m experiencing a gamebreaking bug where after Burke (third racket after 13 hrs of repetitive, exactly the same missions (story and optional missions feel exactly the same, empty and dull.) where no more story missions are popping up or available. So i&#39;m essentially stuck with no way of continueing my playthrough.  In everyway this is a step backwards. SKIP, SKIP, SKIP, SKIP

This is my first no good game. This game is not finished. Do not waste your money to buy it. Do not waste your money to buy it. Do not waste your money to buy it. All the mission is just kill kill kill. Yes, it has a stealth mode, but there always put a lot of enemy in some place that you cannot avoid them in every mission. When you driving, you can see almost all the AI drivers are drunk. The stupid AI even cannot drive car along the street! They&#39;re just block all the street and makes traffic jam. The exprience is a kind of toture when you play a mission to trace a car. Because it&#39;s impossible to finish the mission since the stupid cars all along the street!  You can jump from the door side to other side without be noticed, even the enemy just stare on you. This game have too much bugs, much more beyond what I said.

Well I was really hoping and wishing strong for this game. Been the thing I&#39;ve been really waiting for for about a month, and have keeped an interested eye on it since early this year. I can say, for me, this games has a hard time running, eihter it being low or high end graphics. I don&#39;t have an issue with 30 fps since I have used a ps4 and an xb1. But this isn&#39;t even a smooth 30fps, for me. It is very blurry and jittery. Hard to play really. This game needs some major graphic cleaning, what I mean is smooth gameplay. Hopefully this update planned for this weekend will help. For me again, it is hard to play at this moment. Will hopefully recomend in the future, but now, not recomended. ( PS, my system can run games ranging to fallout 4 to gta v to the division at 60 fps and full 1080 no problem. ) I really wish/ can&#39;t wait to recomend this game.

Before I get into the review, let me say that I love the game, but what the devs did is unforgivable.  I&#39;m not giving this game a positive review to show the devs I don&#39;t support these kinds of ports. It&#39;s sloppy and lazy. Let me go by naming a few:  -Capped 30FPS (of course I had to say it) -Really low quality textures  -Objects clip into eachother  -The view distance is tiny  -The environment in general seems blurry  -Floating bottles  -1080p is blatantly an upscaled 720p (which is the main cause of many of these problems)  -Stuttering framerate -When the game launches, it doesn&#39;t close the launcher, forcing me to go into task manager and close it because it plays music  This is unnacceptable. This shouldn&#39;t become the norm for Triple A PC Releases. This is abhorrent and ridiculous. Hangar 13, I know this is your first major game (I could be wrong), but that doesn&#39;t mean you can do this to your PC community. You know damn well that a huge amount of PC Players can run this game so much better than you&#39;re forcing the entire community to play it at. Fix it, and fix it quick. Once the patch comes out, I&#39;ll edit my review depending on what happens.  EDIT: Now that the game has been patched, the game runs better now, but it&#39;s noticably poorly optimized. Even with the low quality textures the game has, it only gets like 57 fps. It&#39;s ridiculous. Also, the only other thing they changed was the keymapping. There&#39;s still no ability to change graphical settings. You can still only change post processing. Still not recommending.  EDIT 2: After playing for over 10 hours, I think I have a rough idea of what this game is. I thought this was going to be a successor to Mafia 2, but looking back at things, Mafia 2 is eons better. This game is watered down with the same rinse and repeat missions. The main story missions are few and far between, since you have to gain control over an entire territory to unlock it. It&#39;s frustrating and makes this game burn out fast. This game should have been worked on longer. They should have added more main missions rather than the side missions you&#39;re forced to do.  EDIT 3: Well, I beat the game. Can&#39;t say I feel accomplished. Story was alright, but way too overrated. I have no interest in playing afterwards. I feel like I wasted my money and I&#39;m never getting it back. Devs released another patch that fixes blurry upscaled resolution, but it did nothing. I&#39;m done with this game, and I&#39;m not buying another game from Hangar 13; they can kiss my ♥♥♥.

Pretty good game. The story is great, but is let down by a dissapointing and uninteresting ending. There are no twists like in Mafia 1 and 2, the supporting characters get a very small amount of time and care, leaving them forgettable and not really something you care about. The game lacks many details that made the previous two unique.  The three lieutenants are introduced, with an interesting mission and then just neglected for the rest of the game, they play no part in the final outcome or missions after they&#39;re introduced. They&#39;re simply glorified skill trees that give a few repetitive side missions. The only one I found interesting was Vito, and that&#39;s only thanks to the fact he was the protagonist of Mafia 2, and his mission reveals some closure linking to the ending of the previous game. When I reached the final mission I was left underwhelmed. 20 hours of grinding to control the districts, for a very predictable outcome. The voice acting and facial animations are the only things that keep the story interesting, and the characters somewhat memorable.   The big problem I have with the game is the focus on the open world gameplay which was missing from Mafia 2. Instead of including the rackets as side missions, they are all you do in the game. And it really becomes a drag after the first. The map is amazing, and very atmospheric. The streets are full of life, but the world isn&#39;t nearly as believable or interesting as it was in Mafia 2. They completely stripped away the more realistic and interesting police system they had in Mafia 2, and replaced it with a GTA-like shoot on sight system instead, which make interactions with the police more of a chore, rather than a dynamic event like it was in the previous game. Character and vehicle customization has been completely removed, which was a really nice touch in the last games, and I felt it really was missing in this one.  The game also lacks a strong supporting cast. The game focuses too much on Lincoln, while the characters such as James Donovan and Father James are interesting, they get too little screen time to develop.  Mafia 3 is an enjoyable experience, with some great callbacks to previous titles in the series, which I think a lot of fans will appreciate, however the repetitiveness really drags it down, along with the predictable and linear storyline. Get this game while it&#39;s on sale, but if you&#39;re looking for a great experience similair to this game, just get Mafia 2, it&#39;s a lot better.

Mafia III showed promise leading from a great game that Mafia II was along with it&#39;s features including the original Mafia. It seems they have been quite lazy in developing this game although the graphics are good, not the best and the city can be visually good. All they had to do is combine Mafia and Mafia II into Mafia III along with it&#39;s features and customisation. The missions are incredibly repetitive and offer nothing new everytime, it&#39;s go here, interrogate, kill and steal over and over. I&#39;ve read that FREE DLC is coming for customisation but it should have been in the full game already. Mafia III could have been another great Mafia game but without those little features and a more solid, enjoyable mission to play it just is another game that nobody will really look back on or replay it in a hurry.

Mafia III have membership in an exclusive club, where few games belong. It is one of the worst console game ports I have ever played, where the menues, the graphics and the playability is so corrupted by this bad port that i struggle to even try to complete it.   I mean, the game doesn&#39;t even recognize mouse4 and mouse5-buttons when remapping controls.  As this price, I expect a lot more than y2k/hangar 13 has managed to scrape together. It&#39;s an insult to their customers.

Seriously ?   Caped at 30fps ? I hope it will be fixed. Otherwise - the game (preorder) will be the same mistake as with Watchdogs etc. For that moment, poor graphics with 30fps is nothing but back to the past  I recommend to wait till everything will be patched  @edit  Patched, but sill stuttering and FPS around 60 per second (on high end machine)  Optimalization sux :(  But now its playable a little bit

This game certainly had some issues at launch, between the capped fps and the blurry rendering it was fairly hard to play. This being said the devs quickly hot fixed these issues and the game runs very smoothly now. The story is captivating and the gameplay is incredibly fluid and fun. The only draw back being is that the missions become fairly repetative after awhile, but the story is good enough to keep you entertained.

So far I like the game but the 30 fps are too noticeable. Moving the view with mouse is not smooth because of low fps. Waiting for patch to see if it gets any better. If not I&#39;m gonna ditch this game. My rig is more than enough to play this game at well over 60fps. That&#39;s what I paid for.

Even the 60FPS patch didn&#39;t make any difference, this game has serious issues, it doesnt just need polish (which it is sorely lacking) it needs to go back into development to be fixed, and then released later when its actually in a state to be played.

The game is ok... Well let&#39;s start off with the positives...  Positives -   - Fun!  - Lincoln&#39;s facial expressions as well as the other characters are on point.  - THe music is 10/10 with great tracks like &#39;Fortunate Son&#39; and &#39;Paint it Black&#39;  - Some of the weather effects like the rain and so on so forth.  - The setting is great! The young african-american man back from four years in Vietnam in a late 60&#39;s environment in the south.  Cons -   - The game is extremely repetitive, you essentially go around the city doing the same missions whether it&#39;s killing a enforcer or taking out a racket it&#39;s the same thing over and over again.  - Lincoln is one-dimensional, he&#39;s like a psychopath with no real explanation for why he&#39;s killing everybody all that we know is that the mob betrayed him and now he&#39;s out for blood. Other then that there&#39;s nothing.  - The story repetitive and there&#39;s not much to it, it doens&#39;t feel like your playing a true Mafia game like the last one.  - The driving mechanics are just horrible they feel extremely arcadie.  After going thorugh all those reasons it&#39;s sadly safe to say that I would not recommend Mafia III it&#39;s not like Mafia II which was amazing, other then that it&#39;s just not as fun nor good. For now I wouldn;t really recommend buying it unless you want to experience the story which is ok...

Dear 2K,  what exactly did you do to this game? I was really excited about Mafia 3 since the story of Mafia 2 left some questions open and was really fun to play. After installing the game and not having seen any gameplay oder having read any review, the first punch in my face was the graphics. Even GTA V on Xbox 360 looked significantly better than Mafia 3 on PC... Though I don&#39;t have the best rig I expected something else.  The story may be fine but the game is buggy af and thus not enjoyable. Brightness changing from cloudy winter day to sun burning down the earth to ashes and signs reflecting any lights which don&#39;t exist... Man that really cuts off the fun. People don&#39;t actually react on anything u do and if they do, themselves or objects they get in contact with glitch around like in paranormal activity. And one more thing, fckn cars and everything detailed just appears like 50 m before you get there which is one of the worst things ever to me.   DON&#39;T BUY THIS until 2K has fixed this ♥♥♥♥.

The storyline is great, and with a reshade installed the game looks good. But the game crashes alot and the memory allocation and optimization of the game is terrible. This is especially prevelant when you look at whats on display in the game. The game shouldn&#39;t be taxing our systems like this. I&#39;m running a GTX 1080 and the game isn&#39;t stable. The gameplay is actually fun, but its hard to get into because the game crashes every so often. It&#39;s pretty bad, and since there hasn&#39;t been an update on PC to fix the glaring problems with the game, I can&#39;t recommend anyone spend a dime on this. Save your money for a game that is actually put together properly by the developer.

My reasons for giving this a thumbs down are as follows:  - Limited map, it&#39;s all a bit samey. - GTA 5 is better in every way. - Main character has less charisma than a potato. - Skirts the issues of the time but unfortunately:  1. Falls into white man bad, minority good syndrome.  2. Ignores or brushes aside important issues such as how veterans were treated after returning from vietnam. - Ridiculous amount of gameplay padding via collectibles.  Honestly, might as well just have played GTA 5 through again, would have enjoyed it more.

I could ♥♥♥♥♥ and moan about the rather dumb story. I could complain about a lot of things.

negatives  Not as good as the first one (doesn&#39;t feel like open world). The driving and shooting feels unnatural, even though i turned off all the assitance.  Performance issues, despitethe fact that im using an 8gb GTX1070.  cannot skip cut scenes first time around, I dont wanna listen to a haitian drug dealer telling me about how his family was killed, if you lost your family you should probably kill your self and save me the fake french haitian accent. if you die, you might have to go through mroe cut scenes and loading screens jsut to click retry. The wallet safe system could have been simpler. i hate having to visit the same burned down house again and again just to be careful.  limited vehicules, feels like mafia 1 had 10 times more.  Pros:  better than MAFIA II well, goodgraphics is on every AAA game now adays, so whatever, its pretty yes. good story line in general, good performances from the main actors. good atmospher of post-vietnam war era. descent radia stations. alegators.  I just wanna say that im a big fun of the first one, replayed it twice or trice, but this one. i doubt ill even finish it. I feel that the creators should have stuch to their original style. like GTA series does. and thats why funs of GTA and Saint row fans seem to be very loyal. I in the other hand feel like each MAFIA was so different from the previous. and this time you are not even in the MAFIA, you re just killing them.   First MAFIA was like The godfather 1 for me in style and storytelling. secodn one was like: i dont know, good fellas. this one is like. Im playing Shaft or man on fire or something. completly different from the other two,.

Fun for 1 hour and then you realise that the game has absolutely no variation what so ever. You will spend hours and hours doing the exact, same, repetitive ♥♥♥♥ over and over again. 9 districts in the city, talk to Donovan, get 2 people to talk to to start missions that make you interrogate npc, destroy crates and kill enforcers to draw out a &#39;boss&#39;.

Basically a GTA game with a lot less stuff to do, but set in the 1968...  The game had a lot of potential, but was poorly executed. I would reccomend waiting for a Steam sale.  Pros: -60’s timeline is refreshing, not a period covered by many games. -Large map representing New Orleans  -Good soundtrack -Good storyline  Cons: -Verry buggy, has CTD issues (I&#39;m running a i7 6700k / GTX 970) -Not much to do other than the main story, there are no side quest offered by NPC&#39;s  -Horrible enemy AI -Gunplay feels sluggish (the aim assist needs a serious overhaul). -Weather effects are by far the worst I have seen, and are poorly scripted. Rain looks horrible. -Bad textures... WTF is up with the sky??? -NPC’s are way too “cut and paste&#39; -NPC dialogue is painfully repetitive, even worse than the &#39;arrow to the knee&#39; in Skyrim. -Boring selection of weapons with no modifications.  -Your stuck with your vanilla character. No clothing or customization options.

There is a difference between a bad game and a bad port. Mafia 3 is a good game with a subpar port. The gameplay is fun and the story is great. And even though it is TEMPORARILY locked at 30fps, the game runs extremely smoothly with few bugs and no glitches or crashes to speak of.  EDIT: The game has been patched so that it can now run at 60 fps and above. This was the biggest issue, and is now solved. Buy this game.

Meet Lincoln Clay a well established vietnam war vet. who cannot improve his aim or accuracy reload speed, health or stamina unless he makes enough money for some underboss and has to pay to do so. The police don&#39;t give a fudge if you&#39;re speeding, runing red lights, high velocity crashes into traffic or hitting pedestrian ands causing destruction of property, unless you kill someone or bump into the police but oddly when you tail someone theyre aware your every move even if you stop when its green.

In its current state, I cannot recommend this game. It&#39;s a horrendously optimized buggy game at the moment. Which is a shame because the game itself is actually very good. It is more of a GTA game than a Mafia game though, just set in the 60s with the Mafia being the main enemy.

well i can honestly say i am extremely disapointed with mafia 3, after just completing the game. I absolutely loved mafia 2 the story and clothes shopping to tuning and upgrading cars. but mafia 3 lacks most of those things. i&#39;ve experienced tons of bugs and glitches that still haven&#39;t been fixed since release. constantly lagging and major fps drops on a high end pc. extremely repetitive story and side missions. go there, kill him, go back, talk to that guy then go back to the same place to kill another guy.  i was so hyped for this game before release but seems like Hangar 13 ignored everything from mafia 2.  I do not recommend this game nor do i recommend paying the price for it.

It is disappointing. It is nothing old mafias had, nothing. Dont get me wrong, the storyline is fun, it is a great story. Music is also incorporated very well into the game, its catchy and timely, sounds are surreal. Graphics are beautiful, shiny and expensive.  But it is nothing old mafias were, absolutely nothing. It is extremely repetitive, just duck, whistle and stealth kill. You can not die if you drive like idiot, no need to tank gas, can customize cars at all and there is no need actualy to customize them. Drive from place to place, shoot em up, boss, next objective.......yes and dont forget, duck, whistle, stealth kill. AI is on the verge of existance. Do not spend your money it is not good game at all. watch on youtube all the cinematics and play older mafias. I absolutely loved old mafias, the way it incorporates a player into the world there is a no game like it, you are all the time vulnerable and have to watch on details, plan you strike. In mafia 3, call help and shoot or duck, whistle,stealth kill.  Huge dissapointment on my behalf.

Game is just bad.  Graphics are definitely not good.  Playing is extremely boring: once you finshed in a district, you have the exact same missions in another one. AI is the worst: hearing a whistle : &#39;I am sure there is something here!&#39;. Killing the guy right in front of his friend, the other one doesn&#39;t move but then you whistle again: &#39;Hmmmm, strange, I must check it out...&#39;.

My reasons for giving this a thumbs down are as follows:  - Limited map, it&#39;s all a bit samey. - GTA 5 is better in every way. - Main character has less charisma than a potato. - Skirts the issues of the time but unfortunately:  1. Falls into white man bad, minority good syndrome.  2. Ignores or brushes aside important issues such as how veterans were treated after returning from vietnam. - Ridiculous amount of gameplay padding via collectibles.  Honestly, might as well just have played GTA 5 through again, would have enjoyed it more.

Like many people have said, this game felt... akward.  There were NICE moments in the game, like hype for doing a big battle or mission to eliminate a certain person, or how they told the story in many ways, a documentary, released footage of a court case.  But the problem is, well there is a lot of em.  -It felt a bit rushed, a majority of the missions felt like a bad grind and it was more focused when you went to the swamps to only steal cargo of some kind.  -Chances are you and will stick with a certain weapon loadout type, very rarely using other weaponry other then to upgrade said set OR due to a very specific situation.  -I only died like... what 2 times after figuring out how to obliterate easily, one of those times being pinned in a corner due to cops. This was more easier to avoid with a full heal medical kit, and having at least 5 charges for em.  I could go on, but for some odd reason like I said, This game felt rushed somehow.

Take Mafia 2. Remove almost 90% of the ability to interact with the world. Make the game look dark and gritty like Batman. Add 600 minutes of cutscenes. Reduce gameplay down to 10 minutes inbetween cutscenes. Add a really terrible shooting setup. Add crashes and bugs. Now wrap it up with terrible driving physics.  Boom, you just made Mafia 3.

By far the worst mafia game.  Looks really bad for a 2016 game, plays OK but almost everything besides the world and maybe the story needs work.

So after logging 6 hours I couldn&#39;t bear to not share this anymore.   MAFIA III is the most boring game I experienced in a long time and I do not recommend it at all. It destroys one of the greatest legacies of games and it makes me mad. Terrible mad.  Facts: Even though the patch/update now provides 60 fps it is still not what you expect from a game engine nowadays. It is badly made. The interaction with your surrounding is way worse than MAFIA II. It got linear and easy and well - very boring.  Houses are all the same. And yes they really are. It doesn&#39;t matter what mission you do but after 3 hours you have done it already twice. Objects look the same and are even placed on the same spots. I could go on but it would just be a review of these many youtube videos out there in which you can see the sad devastating truth. Mafia III doesn&#39;t feel good and makes you wish the refund option would be available longer than it is right now.   Overall if you want to enjoy the MAFIA legacy be smart and download the old games. They are just better in everything. I regret paying for this game!  Update: It never got better. stay away and safe your money!

I do not normally write reveiws but this game let me down so much I needed to share.   Bugs galore: Cars spin in circles, explode, drive randomly into you npc&#39;s randomly agro / deagro I can stealth kill someone directly in front of another enemy without him noticing me, but if I walk 50m away they agro.  the list goes on and on and on  Flat story line: No real reason to keep playing, the story is flat and is if anything more annoying than helpful I do not feel at all like I was playing a mafia game, there was little to any mob feeling outside of killing the hierarchy of one enemy.  Mafia 2 had a great story in which you climb the ranks into the mob this doesnt even come close  Horrible shooting / driving / enviornment The reason to play these open world games is driving and exploring the world.  So many seemingly flat hills I couldnt walk up bushes are immovable objects couldnt get out of water areas due to invisible walls for no reason would constantly randomly hit invisible barriers while driving near walls causing serious car crash shooting / combat is a complete joke... hide, pop up, headshot, repeat. I used a silenced pistol for the entire game and completely pwned everything even sniper shots across the map magnet hit heads every time with aim assist off.  Driving in grass made cars slow to a complete crawl, sometimes making it impossible to move the car on a mild slope.   TLDR: DONT BUY THIS ♥♥♥♥ING GAME!!!

Mafia 3 in my eyes fails to catch the &#39;mafia&#39; atmosphere-mood.  Sure some of its gameplay is nice, and its called mafia 3 but no &#39;mafia&#39; vipe :(  Its a one-man army run and gun, do rep. mission shooter, with decent story and for some that fine.  But the feel in Mafia 1 &amp;amp; 2 was completly different, something this title sadly is missing.   And to follow it up it feels rushed even after patching.   (For Me)  Pros.::  - Decent Story so far, and decent open map (should be bigger). - Solid mechanics when shooting and covering. - The Lethal or none-lethal option is good, giving variation to kills. - Really Solid soundtrack. - Cutscreens are nice. - Overlaying old sceens and new one&#39;s like a old documentary is nice. - Driving Simulation Mode :)   _______   Cons.::  - Disappointing graphics even on Highest Settings. - NO sense of mafia atmosphere. - Very Horrible optimisation (even after patch). - Some Forgettable characters. - Repetitive missions. - AI : Not Really Any. - The Sky in this game is really ugly and pixelated. - day-night cycle terrible. - No Fast Travel (Even if i feel the map is small, getting rep. missions : get truck, deliver truck.. redo again same spot gets boring driving around then when game running like hell.) - No Real Save Option (random saves).   Small Things bugs or misses.::  - Driving at 90 into wall/house/shop and surviving.. seems legit :| - Disappearing textures, physics bugs. (Same on Low or High Settings). - Rob shop run away, watch shop from afar.. no one calls cops? / cops don&#39;t show (they did in mafia 2).  i5-4670k 4,2ghz GTX 1070 16 GB ddr3 2800mhz Samsung 840 pro 256gb SSD win10 64  On a good day i can play 15-25min at a time until i get Random Crash To Desktop (seems no fix yet, and no! turning off v-sync don&#39;t do it for me like some says).  And with no real save game option this becomes a real downer. And the constant bad fps / optimisation made me download Mafia 2 again.  SO :)  Sadly i can&#39;t recommend this title. In need of even more patching. If you really want to play this game find a REALLY good discount or make sure there&#39;s refund on it.  Alternative go get / play Mafia 2 think my laptop can even play that one on high :)

Every game has it&#39;s ups and downs and Mafia 3 is unfortunately one of them :(  The game itself is enjoyable to play but lacks content and due to that fact the gameplay itself becomes very repetitive , Yes they may be adding racing and more storylines dlc but will that change anything apart from giving the game more driving and shooting to do. So after 98 hrs of repetitive driving and shooting i give the game 5 out of 10 , i may increase if they improve the game more for the players.

well i can honestly say i am extremely disapointed with mafia 3, after just completing the game. I absolutely loved mafia 2 the story and clothes shopping to tuning and upgrading cars. but mafia 3 lacks most of those things. i&#39;ve experienced tons of bugs and glitches that still haven&#39;t been fixed since release. constantly lagging and major fps drops on a high end pc. extremely repetitive story and side missions. go there, kill him, go back, talk to that guy then go back to the same place to kill another guy.  i was so hyped for this game before release but seems like Hangar 13 ignored everything from mafia 2.  I do not recommend this game nor do i recommend paying the price for it.

A superficially pretty-game without much substance or variety.   The soundtrack is gorgeous. And some of the views of New Orleans are breath-taking. The entire concept of a post-Vietnam war era mob game with a black protagonist in that pre-civil rights era is attractive. But unfortunately, while the presentation, voice-acting and cut-scenes are generally very well-done, the characters and protagonists are as shallow and superficial as the game itself.   The main problem with the game is a persistently lack of variety. After the prologue, the entire game appears to be driving around from location to location taking out minions and named mini-bosses to lure out the district boss so you can take over their racket. It&#39;s a concept that&#39;s been done before (GTA 3, etc.). It&#39;s interesting initially and for a while but after a while you come to realise that the entire game seems to be just more of the same (without some of the other distractions that GTA has to offer).  As a &#39;shooter&#39; it&#39;s fairly generic and not in a good way. The gun-fights and realism aren&#39;t particulatly stimulating or gripping. The stealth aspect of the game is interesting initially but lacks polish and variety. Combat in particular suffers from tepid AI - some of the stupidest AI I&#39;ve seen in a long time.   Port-wise: after the patch (why was a patch even necessary?!!), 60fps and uncapped framerate and re-mapping of keys (with correct prompts) make the game more playable. On a machine that can run GTA 5 on close to ultra settings, the sluggish performance of Mafia 3 sugggests that optimization is not great.   Bugs-wise: have not yet run into any game-breaking bugs yet. some minor glitches but nothing too serious and generally the game works as it is intended to.   That&#39;s said, I do regret buying this game. It&#39;s not an awful game. But not a good one by any means. I cannot generally recommend this game even if it is on offer for the simple reason that it gets boring very quickly.

Wait for Steam sale .  This game has a good base but it wasnt finished , it feels more like an Early release then a completed product. Overall id still give this game 6/10 even how it is now.  Within the next few weeks we should see Races , Car customization and outfits. currently there is nothing to do in this open world besides pick up posters and wiretap.  So far even at the current patch im seeing lots of issues  +Frame tearing  +Sun glare issues of vechicle paint +Skybox issues. + Vechicle sounds is a diffent issue. Sounds very animated and fake , almost tinny at times. +Missions are extremly repeatative !  +Police do not give tickets for speeding (no speed signs) nothing for going through a Red light or even for doung burnouts right in front of them LOL It lost most of the details from Mafia 2 funny enough.  Lacking Open World Content Cant get a drink at the bar , no snooker , no card games , no illegal gambiling , no clothing stores , no auto shop. Lots of things that could be in the open world that just isnt. im with you Why an Open World then? i dont know haha  basically dont buy untill its actually working

2016 has been the year of disapointments., and Mafia 3 is the case and point. I have written three reviews for this game but just got to frustrated. CTD 7 times, wretched performance, some of the worst looking textures I have seen in years, the most graphical glitches I have ever seen(the sky can be pixelated at times though that is much better from launch, and the reflextions are broken), and cut scenes that are prerendered(so if it was night and raining it becomes day. I have had a NPC in a car in a cut scene totally change cars after the scene stoped. Seriously day time and sunny getting into a red soft top coupe and then outside of scene night, raining, and blue sedan) Simply this is not finished. Arkam Knight ran about the same at launch and that looked a lot better...   Personally I loved Mafia 1, like Mafia 2, but this is unfinished and I find myself trying to like it. Sure the story has an end and is pretty good(NOT great), but this is a game not a book. I run a 4790k/980ti/16gigs ddr3 ram @2400, this is the only game that currently crashes for me and to retain 60fps 90% of the time I have play @1080p on med/high with AA low or low @ 1440p and sweet Fx to enable SMAA because the AA seems to be FXAA x1(low) x2(med) and blurry(High). Theres promise here, but just to many issues right now. You incandecent pc gamers do not defend this bad port or we will get even more bad ports.   Enough ranting, lets get to the graphics. I will attempt not to rant. You play as a not very at all charismatic ex Nam vet Lincoln Clay, a guy out for revenge. Boring. A black guy out for revenge. Still Boring Hanger 13. Oh the cut scenes look great. The animations are all good, but once in game it feels like not that. The animations are stiff, the people look 2010ie and the trees all look the same. The variety here is bad. From Cars/Trucks/boats(no bikes again), to the people you see. You will see them alot. The same guy infront of you maybe the same guy four people away. I feel like naming them I see them so often. Hi Dave, Hi next Dave. You will see them that much at times. Then theres the animals. Ah, the animals. I saw a gator the size of a boat grab a man in the water and he&#39;s screaming &#39;NO! AHHH!!!&#39;; while it does the death roll and has him under water. Good times. Well thats it. No, really that is the only animal and each gator is a copy and paste. I can&#39;t remember seeing birds. You can correct me but I think I saw a rat in a mission but have not seen one since. You will hear dogs at times, but there are no dogs to find,(they are in the first game) no cats, no deer, no frogs. Just gators and they all look the same and will just appear when an NPC is in the water or at random and each has the same animations. (The gators are ment to be a mechanic of gameplay to hide bodies, but cops/NPC are so dumb this is useless) The enviroments are empty and are barren of a living enviroment. Textures can look ok at times and other times I stop and just look in displeasure. They don&#39;t look finished. Textures can be low res and flat. Even the best ones are equal to Just Cause 3, not anything amazing but would be fine. The reflections look broken with a series of bugs. The cars can reflect fine at times and they attempt to show their period lacquer lead sled paint reflections, but it is the chrome that is the biggest offender. It looks wrong. Just wrong. It does not follow shadows or lighting logic and it is on every car since this is the 60s. The lighting can look good. Night is the most visually pleasing time of day as you don&#39;t notice the lack in detail and the lighting is good. Lights all give off a realistic illumination. The sun does not do this. It is overly bright and foggy haze plagues the daytime. It seems to be foggy because the view distances is very low. There are like four types of trees. The trees all look the same, and a cluster of trees is imposible to walk through. Still at times I forget about these issues because it can look good at times, but glitches and poor design are just as glaring as the blinding sun reflecting off the damp street.   Gameplay is another mix up. Seriously the control feels like Saints Row. Infact the whole game is like a serious saints row or Just Cause 3 with more issues, a serious story, and less stupid fun. Car handling is ok on simulation and I just don&#39;t flat out care about the arcade setting. It doesn&#39;t fit Mafia. In Mafia 1 the not realistic car setting was the automatic trans, what is this nonsense. I want my gears and clutch back! The handling is nothing like reality. Infact the driving is just missing character that big 60s cars have. Drive a 60s Polaris wagon with a 413 Wedgehemi and you will know what I mean.(Handling over 40mph-no, 60-0 breaking-maybe until the drums get heated then nope, speed-YES!) This is like the one thing each Mafia game did well. Sorry, see I&#39;m trying not to rant, but they forgot the manual transmission for Fords sake! G.M. Chrysler would it have been so hard! Anyway. Gameplay is like the Godfather games, so uninspired but it works. The game does have a good selection on guns, but you will only want to use a few of them. The cars that are yours since there is no garage don&#39;t add much outside of your first car and two of the preorder cars. The cars were a huge part of the other two in the series. The game is a go here kill him, go there kill them. Pick a gang faction who are really annoying and sloppily done. Dont get me wrong it is fun at times, and is ok. But just ok. NPC are so bad Saints Row/ Just Cause level. All NPC that talk are in threes, and most are either walking or waiting. Where are they walking? To wait of course. Now go shoot &#39;enemy number xxx&#39; and drive fast take chances. Shooting is compentent, yet feels unfinished. The lever action shotgun has no lever action animation... So you will wait after shooting thinking you are reloaded try to shoot. Don&#39;t hit anything with a car because the damage model is horrible as well as the damage taken just seems broken.   The world of Mafia 3 is empty and deviod of things to do, but the sound is good, voice acting is great and the music is alot of my favorites. From CCR, Hendrix to Roger Miller. Very good sound track and the highlight of the game.  The story is good albiet a bit heavy at times, but now that Im done I am starting to forget a bit of it. The problem is the game is so padded that its good place to take a nap.The story is hours between capturing zones so I stopped caring who I was trying to take down. Most of the times I forgot who I was killing because there is no investment in most of the mini bosses. I had no idea who I was killing half the time in Mafia 3, nor did I give a hoot. The story eneded the way I thought, even down to the choices. It is just such a forgetable game. Mafia 1 I have not beaten that game in over ten years but I remember most of the story/missions, Mafia 2 I remember a decent bit as well. I just finished this game I remember more from Mafia 2.(that world atleast had a lot of atmosphere and felt more living) Outside of the racism there is nothing different in Mafia 3. Though I am glad they didn&#39;t shy away from racism in the 60s, it does feel over done at times; only that is what they were banking on that as the hook&#39;different.&#39; I have no reason to return to the game outside of dlc. There is nothing to do, and since it runs like a fat kid in the woods with no shoes and look like a 360 port; the visuals don&#39;t make me want to return. The cut scenes are done well but the expierence is plagued with averageness inbetween.   I know what your thinking you charming pc users. Hey hot pants, do you recommend it. There is one glarring issue above all others and the reason I say DO NOT RECOMMEND;. It&#39;s not the chrome, the same missions all the time, or even the lifeless world. When you finish the game there is nothing to do and I mean nothing, but look at everything wrong with the game sadly.

So, after spending $60 for this game I would say that it is not something that I wish I bought. The game itself was okay. Graphics and performance left something to be desired. Story line was fantastic and I loved the way they moved through it they way they did, no spoilers. However, the missions themselves were all repetative. Basically do the same thing over and over to get the district under your control and then go kill the boss. You can try to be stealthy to add some flare to the game but it does not give you anything if you do. So you may as well go in there guns blazing because you will most likely survive it. There was little to no customizing your character, Lincoln Clay. Mafia 2 at least offered something to the effect of changing your characters clothes, I assumed this would have been added upon. The only way you can get upgrades on your vehicles is through unlocking them by giving your liutenants rackets and upping their income. But there is no changing the color or wheels or plates or such in the like. Side missions pretty much did not exist in my opinion. There were missions that were &#39;optional&#39; but they all played a part to the overal storyline. The only real side missions were the missions you run as favors for your guys but even then it is pretty much either go here and kill or go here and steal then bring back. Way to simple for that. I expected much more from the game for all the hype that was driven from the previews and I can safely say that I am disappointed. This game is really played for the story I would say. In the end you can chose how it ends essentially 1 of 3 ways. Which were all pretty satisfying actually. I will end it there. If you enjoyed the game, good on you. I would still recommend Mafia 2 over this.

This is my new review since the patch to remove the 30 fps cap. The game is fun but there are a heap of bugs still and low resolution textures. The game still crashes often (usually once or twice every hour). The fps cap has been removed but I&#39;m only getting 40-60fps on average but it&#39;s usually around 40-50 at 1440p with a i7 3770k at 4.4ghz and an overclocked gtx 1070. It still sometimes drops to 30fps. The game is probably too easy as the AI are just really stupid and walk towards you after you kill one of them. The missions are quite repetitive as well. The cut scenes are good and the soundtrack is awesome. It&#39;s just a bad console port and for that reason I would not reccomend buying it. Hopefully the issues will be fixed because it has the potential to be a decent game.

Will agree to most &#39;not recommended&#39; reviews. Story is lacking and game is very repetitive. Can&#39;t complain on graphics or bugs - did not encounter any exept for single crash at first hour of play. However it was strange when after 2 days playing third day found remapped control buttons, most likely by patch, without informing, possibility to go back, etc. so had to learn controls anew. It&#39;s worh a try if you find it on sale later at about 20EUR or less, but not at it&#39;s current price.

Payed 46 Euros for the Digital Deluxe Edition of this game, still feels like I payed about 20 Euros too much. The graphics look more like 2014 than 2016, the gameplay is very repetetive, there are still many bugs left in the game that are annoying and require you to restart in order to continue playing and there are far too many cutscenes.  All in all this is not a worthy sequel to Mafia II, the ONLY good thing about this game is the Soundtrack.

Graphics are not even close to what they show in the trailers. Apparently it&#39;s locked at 30 fps and it doesn&#39;t even give me an option to tinker with the refresh rate so I don&#39;t even know if it&#39;s playing in 144hz. I have a $3000 rig and the game randomly just crashed for no reason. The story is really cliche and boring. I have everything in maxed settings and it still looks like a game on the PS3. I&#39;m really not impressed and this game definitely isn&#39;t worth $60. The cutscenes are way too long, the melee sequences are extremely repetitive, and even on the hardest difficulty the game is easy as ♥♥♥♥. Stealthing seems to just be a waste of time when you can wipe out the entire floor with a machine gun in a millisecond. I wasn&#39;t expecting a GTA 5 but god damn this game isn&#39;t worth $60. I feel like they focused too hard on the cinematics/storyline that they completely forgot they were making a video game and not a movie. It feels like L.A. Noire all over again.

I was excited for this game. I loved the first two, replayed Mafia 2 a few times, when they announced the third one, I was heavily excited. I was skeptical of course, a brand new studio working on this, despite drawing established people from other studios was still a tough pill to swallow, but I followed the game. The amount of pre-release videos drew me in, normally there was never that much pre-release gameplay shown so I figured the game would be alright. Boy was I wrong   It&#39;s obvious from the moment you enter the menus that this is a console port. I was expecting this but what I wasn&#39;t expecting was the general lack of care and polish put into the PC version. Options menu is pretty barren with very little options, not even a texture quality selection. Audio options are standard but not a big issue. Controls are where I have an issue. Rebinding is not great, and is one area where it&#39;s apparent it&#39;s a substandard port. A lot of pc players have mice that have more buttons and yet the game doesn&#39;t recognize these, can&#39;t rebind anything to them. Can&#39;t rebind any actions to clicking the mouse button either. You can always tell if a developer put effort into the pc port by the options menu and it is heavily apparent, they did not.  Now, onto the game. First off, when you change your resolution, it uses upscaling, instead of putting in the effort to make proper options, they went the lazy route. Texture quality is crap and they intentionally hide this via blur effects.Graphics are crap, even on what they consider max settings, changing graphics options does nothing, fairly impressive PCs are struggling to hit 30fps, frakking 30!! That shouldn&#39;t happen on a game that looks this bad.  Now the sad part is, this game could be good. The gunplay is satisfying, driving can be fun, and the story is really damn good. But, I don&#39;t know whether this was developer laziness or whether the publisher imposed deadlines on them that required corners cut, all I know is that the first game out of Hanger 13 is not great at this point in time.

AT LAUNCH: - The game is locked to 30fps - Its graphics are pretty terrible compared to other games that I can run on my PC at a solid 60fps. - Key rebinding rebinds the key but doesn&#39;t allow you to use the new bind. (I accidentally unbound shoot, so I binded it to Mouse1 again but now I cannot shoot. Which is kinda awful. Also rebound M to map, and I&#39;m now stuck in the Tool Tips thing that you get about maps right after you get Lincolns car. This is why I only have 30 mins playtime.) - No binding of controls to extra mouse buttons such as M4, M5 (side buttons) and no binding availiable for side scrolling buttons either. This is quite frustrating as I do bind almost all of my mouse buttons in most of my games.  VERDICT: - Don&#39;t buy it now, it&#39;s a broken piece of crap. - Refund it if you have bought it. - (Re)Buy when the FPS cap is fixed and integral parts of the game (such as keybinding) actually work. - The ability to not be able to bind anything to the same key makes the controls for the game a bit clunky but definately not unplayable.

I love the mafia games on pc. The first one was fantastic for pc and even had steering wheel support with force feedback. Then came mafia 2 and it was great, but they got rid of wheel support and seemed like it was made for consoles so they could get more sales. That&#39;s fine right? as long as the game is playable and the controls are good, I&#39;m happy with that. Then Mafia 3 is out and I try it going in and I&#39;ve been waiting long for this being a fan of the series. The game starts and the framerate is very slow, even running on a gtx 1070. I find out that the game is capped at 30hz. ♥♥♥♥ing ridiculous. Why would they do that, it looks like the game is running on the hardware of an N64. I try playing the game nontheless and I am driving through town. I&#39;m trying to figure out how to use the car horn so I look in the control settings and it shows the map of controls for an xbox controler. This game is not ready for PC. It&#39;s a cheap console port. Unless you want to play with an xbox controller and tollerate a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ framerate then go ahead and purchase this game and you&#39;ll be happy. Otherwise wait until they get their ♥♥♥♥ together and realize the potential of the pc gaming market.

Ok. Lets start with the elephant in the room. First of all, this game WAS framerate locked at 30FPS on launch. LAME. It took the developers about 30 hours (after an uproar from PC gamers) to patch the game. Now the framerate is unlocked. Additionally, the patch appears to have polished the game in a few other ways as well. If you were holding off because of this, now is the time to buy, as it has been resolved. I&#39;m frankly annoyed that the issue was there to begin with, but I&#39;m also extremely impressed at how quickly it was patched. This game is raw, and gritty. I like that! They don&#39;t attempt to hide any racial tension, swear words, gore, or anything else that might offend anyone. This is a raw gangster story, and thats what the Mafia games have always been about. It is slightly strange to be taking down the Italian Mob that we worked so hard on building in the last 2 games, but the new characters are voiced well, interesting, and well written. I&#39;m ok with this too! This game goes out on a limb and takes risks. They are portraying content that some may not like, and making a huge change on a beloved series. As a MASSIVE Mafia 2 fan, I&#39;m actually ok with this. I would like to see Mafia 4 return to the Italian mob, as that bunch has always been a fun one to explore, but I&#39;m ok with this detour. This game explores the other side of the Italian Mob. What happens when they run over the wrong people. Ect. If you like open world games, this is certainly worth a purchase. Especially when I see that we have been given some wonderful options like disabling aim assitance and field of view. I do wish there were a few more graphical choices in the settings menu, but overall I am pleased with my purchase, and post-patch I&#39;ve decided NOT to refund. Enjoy! -PR0XIDIAN

I do not normally write reveiws but this game let me down so much I needed to share.   Bugs galore: Cars spin in circles, explode, drive randomly into you npc&#39;s randomly agro / deagro I can stealth kill someone directly in front of another enemy without him noticing me, but if I walk 50m away they agro.  the list goes on and on and on  Flat story line: No real reason to keep playing, the story is flat and is if anything more annoying than helpful I do not feel at all like I was playing a mafia game, there was little to any mob feeling outside of killing the hierarchy of one enemy.  Mafia 2 had a great story in which you climb the ranks into the mob this doesnt even come close  Horrible shooting / driving / enviornment The reason to play these open world games is driving and exploring the world.  So many seemingly flat hills I couldnt walk up bushes are immovable objects couldnt get out of water areas due to invisible walls for no reason would constantly randomly hit invisible barriers while driving near walls causing serious car crash shooting / combat is a complete joke... hide, pop up, headshot, repeat. I used a silenced pistol for the entire game and completely pwned everything even sniper shots across the map magnet hit heads every time with aim assist off.  Driving in grass made cars slow to a complete crawl, sometimes making it impossible to move the car on a mild slope.   TLDR: DONT BUY THIS ♥♥♥♥ING GAME!!!

ATTENTION HANGER 13!!!! Over all this sucks. SUPER dissapointed.  I would NOT buy this game yet!!! Its filled with terrible terrible optimization errors. Im playing on a GTX 1080! yeah... i didnt expect my 800$ graphics card to not be able to play this like I imagend. The cut scenes are extremely miss leading and thats what i thought i could have with my $1800 rig. WHY!? why does every area have a layer of haze over the screen?. I thought my tv was broken. It has minimal tweaks not allowing to select HBAO+ or SSAO or MSAAx4 or A DISABLE BLOOM feautre you cant add debris effects or interact with anything except doors and cars and people even turning on a light switch would be nice or grabbing a beer from the fridge or sinks! why is there no interaction. The reflections are crap from mirrors to metal and the skybox is terrible! it all looks like ♥♥♥♥. for a 2016 game... COME ON!!!! seriusly check out Mafia 2 and its ahead of this game it even looks better! AMAZING cut scenes but thats not why i baught the game

I was excited for this game. I loved the first two, replayed Mafia 2 a few times, when they announced the third one, I was heavily excited. I was skeptical of course, a brand new studio working on this, despite drawing established people from other studios was still a tough pill to swallow, but I followed the game. The amount of pre-release videos drew me in, normally there was never that much pre-release gameplay shown so I figured the game would be alright. Boy was I wrong   It&#39;s obvious from the moment you enter the menus that this is a console port. I was expecting this but what I wasn&#39;t expecting was the general lack of care and polish put into the PC version. Options menu is pretty barren with very little options, not even a texture quality selection. Audio options are standard but not a big issue. Controls are where I have an issue. Rebinding is not great, and is one area where it&#39;s apparent it&#39;s a substandard port. A lot of pc players have mice that have more buttons and yet the game doesn&#39;t recognize these, can&#39;t rebind anything to them. Can&#39;t rebind any actions to clicking the mouse button either. You can always tell if a developer put effort into the pc port by the options menu and it is heavily apparent, they did not.  Now, onto the game. First off, when you change your resolution, it uses upscaling, instead of putting in the effort to make proper options, they went the lazy route. Texture quality is crap and they intentionally hide this via blur effects.Graphics are crap, even on what they consider max settings, changing graphics options does nothing, fairly impressive PCs are struggling to hit 30fps, frakking 30!! That shouldn&#39;t happen on a game that looks this bad.  Now the sad part is, this game could be good. The gunplay is satisfying, driving can be fun, and the story is really damn good. But, I don&#39;t know whether this was developer laziness or whether the publisher imposed deadlines on them that required corners cut, all I know is that the first game out of Hanger 13 is not great at this point in time.

With this 60 fps patch they released, I am getting 22 fps in the city on low and high. My pc is better than the reccomended specs (check my profile). So they just rushed out a patch without really testing it at all... I haven&#39;t been able to play for 5 minutes...

Graphics are the same on MAX and LOW, check this comparison video below.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtjfXZnNCds   Even with a GTX 1080 at 1920x1080P the game hits just over 60fps!

Graphics are not even close to what they show in the trailers. Apparently it&#39;s locked at 30 fps and it doesn&#39;t even give me an option to tinker with the refresh rate so I don&#39;t even know if it&#39;s playing in 144hz. I have a $3000 rig and the game randomly just crashed for no reason. The story is really cliche and boring. I have everything in maxed settings and it still looks like a game on the PS3. I&#39;m really not impressed and this game definitely isn&#39;t worth $60. The cutscenes are way too long, the melee sequences are extremely repetitive, and even on the hardest difficulty the game is easy as ♥♥♥♥. Stealthing seems to just be a waste of time when you can wipe out the entire floor with a machine gun in a millisecond. I wasn&#39;t expecting a GTA 5 but god damn this game isn&#39;t worth $60. I feel like they focused too hard on the cinematics/storyline that they completely forgot they were making a video game and not a movie. It feels like L.A. Noire all over again. I give it a solid 2/10

AT LAUNCH: - The game is locked to 30fps - Its graphics are pretty terrible compared to other games that I can run on my PC at a solid 60fps. - Key rebinding rebinds the key but doesn&#39;t allow you to use the new bind. (I accidentally unbound shoot, so I binded it to Mouse1 again but now I cannot shoot. Which is kinda awful. Also rebound M to map, and I&#39;m now stuck in the Tool Tips thing that you get about maps right after you get Lincolns car. This is why I only have 30 mins playtime.) - No binding of controls to extra mouse buttons such as M4, M5 (side buttons) and no binding availiable for side scrolling buttons either. This is quite frustrating as I do bind almost all of my mouse buttons in most of my games.  VERDICT: - Don&#39;t buy it now, it&#39;s a broken piece of crap. - Refund it if you have bought it. - (Re)Buy when the FPS cap is fixed and integral parts of the game (such as keybinding) actually work. - The ability to not be able to bind anything to the same key makes the controls for the game a bit clunky but definately not unplayable.

I love the mafia games on pc. The first one was fantastic for pc and even had steering wheel support with force feedback. Then came mafia 2 and it was great, but they got rid of wheel support and seemed like it was made for consoles so they could get more sales. That&#39;s fine right? as long as the game is playable and the controls are good, I&#39;m happy with that. Then Mafia 3 is out and I try it going in and I&#39;ve been waiting long for this being a fan of the series. The game starts and the framerate is very slow, even running on a gtx 1070. I find out that the game is capped at 30hz. ♥♥♥♥ing ridiculous. Why would they do that, it looks like the game is running on the hardware of an N64. I try playing the game nontheless and I am driving through town. I&#39;m trying to figure out how to use the car horn so I look in the control settings and it shows the map of controls for an xbox controler. This game is not ready for PC. It&#39;s a cheap console port. Unless you want to play with an xbox controller and tollerate a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ framerate then go ahead and purchase this game and you&#39;ll be happy. Otherwise wait until they get their ♥♥♥♥ together and realize the potential of the pc gaming market.

So, normally I don&#39;t harp on graphics but even at 4k this game looks bad, the animations in particular are total rubbish. The settings revert themselves after starting the game from the launch pad, forcing you to reset them in the game.  The controls are insane, who in their right mind thought it was a good idea to make the page down key the weapon quick swap key, are you kidding me? Sure, you can easily remap the keys, but it shows that they overlooked the PC version/wanted you to use a controller to play.   Maybe the patch they are releasing will fix some of the small issues, but right now the game feels unfinished, and I&#39;m not sure I want to wait for it to release to see if I still want a refund.  It is no wonder 2k didn&#39;t release any copies of this for review.   TL:DR Hold off for now, it has issues.

Damn, so disappointing about this game. This is nowhere near Mafia or Mafia 2. This is simply just ♥♥♥♥♥♥ spinoff. Ok, there is nice cutscenes, but graphics itself isnt that good looking. I actually reinstalled Mafia 2 and damn, that still looks awesome!   Conns:  - Guns feel like bbguns - Cars damage physics are ♥♥♥♥♥♥ - Police are like in GTA. Always tries to kill you. - Lincoln is clumsy af. Cannot jump or climb up over even a small step. - After couple of hour game play game already started to repeat it self. Kinda reminds me about old &#39;The Godfather&#39; -game  All summed up, this is really dissappointing game. Wish 2K Czeck would have done this game instead this ♥♥♥♥♥♥ Hangar 13.

Well, first of all 2K did a fab job of hyping this game, most properly to get their cash back asap, as they knew it was rushed and flawed, i see speed bouts flying past me and i havent had a drink, honest officer!  After a few hours i got the hang of it, controls are crap for PC so i went to the xbox controller, after 10 hours, just 10 HOURS! i was bored sensless, sad as i pre purchased the game, on all the hype, as i said on 2K Utube, never will i ever pre purchase a game ever again. EVER, thanks to 2K.  Now im up to 23 hours+ i just cant be bothered to play anymore, i start the game and once loaded, i quit and its just be bothered to do the same thing over and over again, another rinse and repeat title.  I do wheelspins and donuts in front of the cops, they look and walk offm so i chuck nades at the cops, they chase me, i hide, they leave i do it all again for some action, open world seems dormant, people walk around doing, well nothing? i plough through pedestrians on the pavement, in my shiney car, no damage so i do more and rack up the murder total, I get out shoot them, just because im so bored, so its anther £40-£50 down the drain.

Bad game overall at this point.  - 30fps locked. - Maxed out 4K with AA set to &#39;Low&#39; takes dips to 26fps on GTX 1080. - Textures are looking horrendous. - Doesn&#39;t look like a game as it was portrayed from gameplay videos, not even in visuals. - 4K scaling is bad, very very bad. The map and everything else is tiny. - It literally looks like a copy/paste from console version. - It looks decent at night times but not as good as shown in gameplay videos, day time is ugly.  Was eagerly waiting for this game to release, pre-ordered and everything just to find this poop of a product. Will update the review once patch is out, tried looking around in config files and couldn&#39;t find any option to unlock framerates but will continue to look further. Such a shame, I had high hopes for it. Will still play it for the storyline and what not, but this is a bummer. I doubt patches will revamp this game to a level one would want to play in 4K, it&#39;ll make it better but not turning too serious I&#39;m afraid unless 2K can surprise us.  I&#39;d suggest wait until they fix the game at least.    // EDIT: 5:24 PM Saturday, 8 October 2016 (PT) after Patch 1.01

Simply bad... after only 4h I realised the game is just way too shallow and just not worth any of my time. Money is better spent on Indie titles these days than overhyped AAA titles that get pushed out way too early. And wtf is up with the skybox?? That looks like super mario on the N64, heck that skybox looked better... Then add the random crashes... enough. Then when you compare with Mafia II it hits you in the face that M2 actually had more depth than this game..   Sad really. The story is good, the cutscenes are good but the rest, well just shallow.

This is so infuriating! I can tell that Mafia 3 has a great game hidden under the metric ton of ♥♥♥♥ its been shipped with. The characters are interesting, the style in which the story is being delivered so far is new and captivating.  But yes, there&#39;s a multitude of problems that have arrived with its release. The 30fps is a pain in the ♥♥♥♥, sure, but I would be able to look passed that if it was polished elsewhere. However, the texures are abysmal, and the pop-in is horrendous. Even If I dismissed those glaring problems as well, I would still be left disappointed. Due to the 30fps, I&#39;m playing with a controller, as I find the framerate more managable that way. But, I have to put up with the missing button prompts. Not even the &#39;controller layout&#39; page shows the button mapping.  I know the devs have been working hard to fix this, but until they do, the frustation is not worth it. Wait until you hear of some major patch work before forking out for this game.  Damnit Mafia 3! I really want to play you!  [EDIT]  The patch has been release to unlock the framerate. But the bugs and stability is still a ♥♥♥♥ show. Games seems ok other than those issues.

I&#39;ll start with the good things. Donovan, awesome character, awesome dialogue and awesome even though short, moments with him, especially the credits scene. The atmosphere while sometimes weird due to strange cloud speed and fast weather changes, was pretty good. Soundtrack is sort of a mixed bag, I personally didnt like it that much, but I wont comment much since it depends on each persons music taste. Ok&#39;ish stealth mechanics, i certainly liked going stealthy rather than full on assault, so that was a plus. Now the bad things are pretty much everything thats left, sadly. The story, the characters that arent fleshed out as much as I wanted, such as Vitto( you do find out what happens to Joe though I have a feeling regarding an ending scene that what Vitto revealed might not be the case), the gameplay is horribly boring, lacks excitement, basically the game is the most average game I&#39;ve played. Its not bad but its not good either. You wont miss anything for not playing the game, hence why Im not recommending it, maybe if it goes on sale under 15$.

Where to start... First off let me say that I am a big fan of the Mafia series and had high hopes for this game.  This game has a VERY rich story, which is something I can&#39;t fault it for. That being said almost every other aspect of this game is lacking, HEAVILY.  Performance wise this game is having a hard time being run even by amazing hardware at anything above 1080p. I currently run an i5-4690k clocked at 4.3GHz paired with a 780ti. I currently have no problem running GTA V at pretty much max settings at 2k resolution. This game at 2k resolution unless set to low settings nets me around 30 frames. All of this is if the game decides not to crash itself after 30 minutes or so.   Gameplay is very repetitive as many other reviews will claim, this game is all about claiming territory from Sal Marcano and his criminal enterpise. A district has 2 lieutenants and 1 capo. To find and murder these people you must complete redundant tasks such as interrogating people for information, destroying and taking money from places they run, or simply killing a target. This causes the lieutenant to come out of hiding, then after completing that you do a mission to get the capo out of hiding and kill them. The side missions are one and the same, either kill or fetch tasks that never bring anything new to the table.   Visually the game does not look good at all, I&#39;ve been told that the textures are all in 720p and then sampled up to your resolution, a telltale sign of a console port.   There are a few things that I want to point out in gameplay and realism that this game did very poorly: #1 AI #2 Physics #3 Realism  As far as AI goes no matter what difficulty you are on all AI will be lumbering idiots that couldn&#39;t stop a fly. You can&#39;t interact with any non essential characters in the game besides saying hello every once in a while. For the game taking place in the south in the 1960&#39;s and for the cops being bought off by Sal Marcano you&#39;d think they&#39;d be a big obstacle for a colored man. The police won&#39;t bat an eye unless called. Speed past them through a red light? nothing. Hit a car going 90 miles an hour right in front of them? Nothing. Barely bump their car? They have an apb out on you and shoot to kill. Though for what it is I will say the system of cops not having some sort of internal gps that lets them always know where you are after someone reports a crime is a good step away from the gameplay of GTA where cops know every single time where you are. Also the shotgun toting mafiosos who think they&#39;re invinvible is a bit dim.   For physics this game barely has any, Lincoln can jump out of a car completely horizontally no matter what speed he&#39;s going and and land exactly next to where his door was when he jumped out. Cars magically hop into the air when being hit.   For realism? Lets talk about how car crashes at 90mph don&#39;t kill you, and barely scratch your car, gators are invincible and always are there to eat a body after it falls remotely in a body of water among other things.  In Mafia 2 you could actually shoot enough that the hubcap of the car would come off. Car crashes at even 50 mph could kill you instantly. You can hit any random non hostile npc with one melee and they&#39;re instantly knocked out, there are no consequences for robbing a store beides the police might get called, even if you murder someone in there (wheras in mafia 2 you couldn&#39;t go back for a while and there was police tape).   Is this review well written and formatted? Probably not. Does it accurately describe the state of this game? I think so.  I had been trying to just accept this game so much, being a fan of the series, I wanted it to be good but the more I took a good look at it I saw what a dissapointment it really was. Even if this game had looked good and ran great across the board I don&#39;t think it would be worth it. They took a really engaging story and ruined everything else inbetween. Territory grabbing missions are just pointless things that lead to unlock more bits of the story. You can&#39;t customise your character in any way, your cars in any way, have a garage to store them. Little bits of detail like bums, and small npc interactions would make this game feel a lot more real. Overall I wish that the developers of this game hadn&#39;t let us down in this way. The opening mission was great, do this, drive here, and then there were different steps to complete to finish. They were all important and drove everything forward. That was how they should have done the whole game, open world but actual missions instead of annoying chore like tasks. Nobody playing a Mafia game wants to run the day to day operations, but to understand and delve deep into what being in the mob actually feels like, the nitty gritty bits, the fighting, the honor code, all that.   I give this game a 5/10, and that may just be me being generous.

Mafia 1 and 2 are much better games. Mafia 3 is basically objectively bad, you do the same ♥♥♥♥ to draw someone out to kill them and rinse repeat until the end. It&#39;s tedious and a chore to play. After the first 2 hours you&#39;ve seen everything the game has to offer and then it just sends you to different regions of the city hitting rackets again until enough damage is inflicted to draw out another enemy to kill.

Mafia III, the follow up to the legendary Mafia and Mafia II video games. I was very hyped for this game and was anticipating an epic game much like Grand Theft Auto V. However, there are a few things that make gameplay a less enjoyable experience.  Let me start off by saying the story is excellent, and while I haven&#39;t played through the entire game yet, I will hopefully change this review by the end of all the DLCs and updates. The story is very engaging and unique. There are also plenty of elements that reinforce the notion of racism during this period: such as when police respond slower and the dispatcher uses words like &#39;maybe&#39; in poorer, black neighborhoods.  However, story aside, the game is hard to love when the physics and graphics are sub-par. While the game does look pretty at times, there are some glaring details I cannot forgive. The first thing you&#39;ll notice is that the graphics are wonky at times. The lighting and reflections and wonky and the chrome on the cars looks more like matte plastic with a metallic paint. Sometimes the immediate world also darkens and lightens as if the developers wanted to emulate clouds obscuring the sun intermittently but it comes across as jarring. At night New Bordeaux looks very beautiful though. I think the developer added too many post-process effects that take away from the performance, this should be looked into but I think the only way to fix this is to redo the entire game engine.  As mentioned the physics and overall feel of the game is lacking. Driving feels like the cars are driving with ice wheels. While yes, older American cars had wonky and floaty suspensions, and the game allows them to leans as such, the wheels are like they are made of ice and the cars feel lighter than they look. The physical damage on cars is also dissapointing as I was looking up to GTA V and taking cues from older movies where the sheet metal cars would actually tear themselves apart after a collision. Colliding with people also seems like an unfinished feature. I feel the devs would have had a better time if they used Natural Motion as the people are more like lamp posts with animations coming in late. Sometimes the AI driven cars have erratic driving that is pretty annoying to deal with: they would be spinning around in an &#39;S&#39; shape right in front of me and would clip through other cars until they are right in front of me, where the game engine decides that they should have collision again.  Another point of contention is general gameplay. I&#39;m currently in the stage where I&#39;m running introductory jobs for Cassandra, Vito, and Burke. But all of these characters have had the same type of missions to regain control of their respective territories: go there, bop that guy until the big boss guy gets anfry and shows his face, go back to the same large wardehouse place you bopped one guy to get the big guy, finished. As stated, I haven&#39;t finished the main story yet, but I hope the missions are not going to be monogamous for the rest of the crew again.  Tldr; well told story, everything else is sub-par. Get this game on sale or a few years down the line.

I&#39;ve played the game for about 1 hour right after downloading it. It ran fine although with 30 FPS locked. However my GTX 960 4GB usage was quite low - about 55-60% - which is expected for 30 frames. So I hoped everything will be just great when developers release 60 FPS and unlimited FPS patch.  Then after an hour smooth ran (in 30 FPS) game crashed and refused to launch again. I tried eveything I could find to resolve the issue but no luck. The only thing that helped me - rolling back Nvidia drivers to previous version, BUT it was running fine on the latest drivers before that crush, WTF?! Now game runs like a crap - not playable at all.  My PC specs - Intel i5-4690k @3.9 Ghz, 16 GB RAM, Nvidia Geforce GTX 960 4GB.  I&#39;m very dissapointed. Would not recommend to buy this game...at least now. Also seriously considering to make refund if the patch doesn&#39;t come and fix all this within this weekend. Shame on you developers!

I&#39;ll start with the good things. Donovan, awesome character, awesome dialogue and awesome even though short, moments with him, especially the credits scene. The atmosphere while sometimes weird due to strange cloud speed and fast weather changes, was pretty good. Soundtrack is sort of a mixed bag, I personally didnt like it that much, but I wont comment much since it depends on each persons music taste. Ok&#39;ish stealth mechanics, i certainly liked going stealthy rather than full on assault, so that was a plus. Now the bad things are pretty much everything thats left, sadly. The story, the characters that arent fleshed out as much as I wanted, such as Vitto( you do find out what happens to Joe though I have a feeling regarding an ending scene that what Vitto revealed might not be the case), the gameplay is horribly boring, lacks excitement, basically the game is the most average game I&#39;ve played. Its not bad but its not good either. You wont miss anything for not playing the game, hence why Im not recommending it, maybe if it goes on sale under 15$.

I was excited to get and play Mafia 3. Watching the live E3 footage and getting the tshirt they handed out to the on hands attendees. After playing the game for near 7-8 hours I started noticing mission bugs. Then it just continued on and on and on and on. Now I am stuck in the story line because of these bugs. I am highly upset that I can not return this POS game. From Massives giant F-up with &#39;The Division&#39; to Edios &#39;Duex Ex Manking Divied&#39; and now on to this POS game. I am disapointed in the developers and publishers of these games. Yes I am looking at you Ubisoft, 2k and Square Enix. For the love of god fix your QC process NOW.   TLDR: Do not buy this Crappy game. Wait 6 months and get it for 15 bucks. Waste of money and NVMe Space.

Where to start... First off let me say that I am a big fan of the Mafia series and had high hopes for this game.  This game has a VERY rich story, which is something I can&#39;t fault it for. That being said almost every other aspect of this game is lacking, HEAVILY.  Performance wise this game is having a hard time being run even by amazing hardware at anything above 1080p. I currently run an i5-4690k clocked at 4.3GHz paired with a 780ti. I currently have no problem running GTA V at pretty much max settings at 2k resolution. This game at 2k resolution unless set to low settings nets me around 30 frames. All of this is if the game decides not to crash itself after 30 minutes or so.   Gameplay is very repetitive as many other reviews will claim, this game is all about claiming territory from Sal Marcano and his criminal enterpise. A district has 2 lieutenants and 1 capo. To find and murder these people you must complete redundant tasks such as interrogating people for information, destroying and taking money from places they run, or simply killing a target. This causes the lieutenant to come out of hiding, then after completing that you do a mission to get the capo out of hiding and kill them. The side missions are one and the same, either kill or fetch tasks that never bring anything new to the table.   Visually the game does not look good at all, I&#39;ve been told that the textures are all in 720p and then sampled up to your resolution, a telltale sign of a console port.   There are a few things that I want to point out in gameplay and realism that this game did very poorly: #1 AI #2 Physics #3 Realism  As far as AI goes no matter what difficulty you are on all AI will be lumbering idiots that couldn&#39;t stop a fly. You can&#39;t interact with any non essential characters in the game besides saying hello every once in a while. For the game taking place in the south in the 1960&#39;s and for the cops being bought off by Sal Marcano you&#39;d think they&#39;d be a big obstacle for a colored man. The police won&#39;t bat an eye unless called. Speed past them through a red light? nothing. Hit a car going 90 miles an hour right in front of them? Nothing. Barely bump their car? They have an apb out on you and shoot to kill. Though for what it is I will say the system of cops not having some sort of internal gps that lets them always know where you are after someone reports a crime is a good step away from the gameplay of GTA where cops know every single time where you are. Also the shotgun toting mafiosos who think they&#39;re invinvible is a bit dim.   For physics this game barely has any, Lincoln can jump out of a car completely horizontally no matter what speed he&#39;s going and and land exactly next to where his door was when he jumped out. Cars magically hop into the air when being hit.   For realism? Lets talk about how car crashes at 90mph don&#39;t kill you, and barely scratch your car, gators are invincible and always are there to eat a body after it falls remotely in a body of water among other things.  In Mafia 2 you could actually shoot enough that the hubcap of the car would come off. Car crashes at even 50 mph could kill you instantly. You can hit any random non hostile npc with one melee and they&#39;re instantly knocked out, there are no consequences for robbing a store beides the police might get called, even if you murder someone in there (wheras in mafia 2 you couldn&#39;t go back for a while and there was police tape).   Is this review well written and formatted? Probably not. Does it accurately describe the state of this game? I think so.  I had been trying to just accept this game so much, being a fan of the series, I wanted it to be good but the more I took a good look at it I saw what a dissapointment it really was. Even if this game had looked good and ran great across the board I don&#39;t think it would be worth it. They took a really engaging story and ruined everything else inbetween. Territory grabbing missions are just pointless things that lead to unlock more bits of the story. You can&#39;t customise your character in any way, your cars in any way, have a garage to store them. Little bits of detail like bums, and small npc interactions would make this game feel a lot more real. Overall I wish that the developers of this game hadn&#39;t let us down in this way. The opening mission was great, do this, drive here, and then there were different steps to complete to finish. They were all important and drove everything forward. That was how they should have done the whole game, open world but actual missions instead of annoying chore like tasks. Nobody playing a Mafia game wants to run the day to day operations, but to understand and delve deep into what being in the mob actually feels like, the nitty gritty bits, the fighting, the honor code, all that.   I give this game a 5/10, and that may just be me being generous.

After the update the game is improved and there is now a steady FPS and the textures are no longer blurry and grainy. I love the enviroment and the music of the era, it really is nice to see a little something of what the 70&#39;s was like in this game. Even though I love everything about the game I still cannot recommend it for the performance, sure the game is now over 30 FPS and is now at a FPS that bounces between 25 to 60 FPS, mostly 40 though. Funny thing is that I am right with the game recommendations that are listed talking about having a GTX 780 or 8GB of RAM. I don&#39;t wanna sound like a freak that wants everything looking 100% but, I can&#39;t bring myself to play it with the all the FPS issues, makes me really sick to drive at a solid 25 FPS on a 144Hz monitor...

Mafia III, the follow up to the legendary Mafia and Mafia II video games. I was very hyped for this game and was anticipating an epic game much like Grand Theft Auto V. However, there are a few things that make gameplay a less enjoyable experience.  Let me start off by saying the story is excellent, and while I haven&#39;t played through the entire game yet, I will hopefully change this review by the end of all the DLCs and updates. The story is very engaging and unique. There are also plenty of elements that reinforce the notion of racism during this period: such as when police respond slower and the dispatcher uses words like &#39;maybe&#39; in poorer, black neighborhoods.  However, story aside, the game is hard to love when the physics and graphics are sub-par. While the game does look pretty at times, there are some glaring details I cannot forgive. The first thing you&#39;ll notice is that the graphics are wonky at times. The lighting and reflections and wonky and the chrome on the cars looks more like matte plastic with a metallic paint. Sometimes the immediate world also darkens and lightens as if the developers wanted to emulate clouds obscuring the sun intermittently but it comes across as jarring. At night New Bordeaux looks very beautiful though. I think the developer added too many post-process effects that take away from the performance, this should be looked into but I think the only way to fix this is to redo the entire game engine.  As mentioned the physics and overall feel of the game is lacking. Driving feels like the cars are driving with ice wheels. While yes, older American cars had wonky and floaty suspensions, and the game allows them to leans as such, the wheels are like they are made of ice and the cars feel lighter than they look. The physical damage on cars is also dissapointing as I was looking up to GTA V and taking cues from older movies where the sheet metal cars would actually tear themselves apart after a collision. Colliding with people also seems like an unfinished feature. I feel the devs would have had a better time if they used Natural Motion as the people are more like lamp posts with animations coming in late. Sometimes the AI driven cars have erratic driving that is pretty annoying to deal with: they would be spinning around in an &#39;S&#39; shape right in front of me and would clip through other cars until they are right in front of me, where the game engine decides that they should have collision again.  Another point of contention is general gameplay. I&#39;m currently in the stage where I&#39;m running introductory jobs for Cassandra, Vito, and Burke. But all of these characters have had the same type of missions to regain control of their respective territories: go there, bop that guy until the big boss guy gets anfry and shows his face, go back to the same large wardehouse place you bopped one guy to get the big guy, finished. As stated, I haven&#39;t finished the main story yet, but I hope the missions are not going to be monogamous for the rest of the crew again.  Tldr; well told story, everything else is sub-par. Get this game on sale or a few years down the line.

I was highly looking forward to this game. However upon launching it was clear the developers had never considered ultrawide monitors (at least for the unusable menus) I was able to look past this somewhat big issue. Even the 30fps cap at first wasn&#39;t a total deal breaker for me. What really upset me was loosing a good 5 hours of campaign progress TWICE. Apparently there is an autosave after every mission but 2-3 seprate times the game did not save any progress. I made it up to the part where you clear the brothel each time. Randomly died and was reset all the way back to the swamp mission where you bill the hatian leader. ALL OF MY PROGRESS NEVER SAVED and I wasted a good 10 hours of my life. I tried looking for a solution online but nothing helped there was no data for any of my saves in the game files. Nothing to show for all my hours playing.

Do not buy.  Mafia 2 is infinitely better, play that instead.   Even without the bugs, the game is repetitive and contains none of the little details that made Mafia 2 stand out from GTA. Poor graphics quality, upscaled 720p, poor optimisation, 30fps locked at launch. It&#39;s obvious that this is the studios first game. On the surface it looks like a compotent GTA clone set in the 60s, but in reality it has little content and nothing to make it stand out. The cars don&#39;t feel like ♥♥♥♥, but not a lot of effort was put into their functionality and mechanics.   Reminds me of Watchdogs.

Summary:  All this game is is the same mission a million times over, and then you get to one unique mission, then back to the same repetitive bullcrap until you get to the next unique mission, and the cycle repeats. Those unique missions are fun, just not worth getting to. Not worth $60.  Pros:  -Good Graphics -Good Driving Mechanics -Fun Combat -Top Notch Voice Acting and Motion Capture -Great Soundtrack -Vito Scaletta  Cons:  -WHY IN HELL IS THE CLASSIC TOMMY GUN DLC?!?!? -2k gave a great franchise in the hand of first time developers -Repetitive and boring -Season Pass -Not enough Vito -Lincoln is a ♥♥♥♥ -Cassandra is annoying -Terrible skybox  Conclusion:  I preordered this game as soon as I was able to being that I am a huge fan of the franchise, owning both Mafia and Mafia II. Mafia II is one of my favorite games of all time, so when I was able to buy this I went full Fry from Futurama and said &#39;Shut up and take my money!&#39;. Sadly I failed to realize that this was Hangar 13&#39;s first game, and as more and more gameplay was released I saw that the game might be repetitve. I didn&#39;t care, however, being the massive fanboy that I am and I preordered the deluxe edition. There is no way that this game is worth $60, so it sure as hell ain&#39;t worth $80. This game was a massive failure. Do yourself a favor and buy Mafia II. You&#39;ll get your money&#39;s worth from that masterpiece.

(Spoilers)I just want to start off by telling you i really enjoyed this game when i was able to play it. After 27 hours in game ive experienced a game breaking bug. My story missions refuse to show on the map. After i killed the hitman sal sent after me the game bugged. After i killed him somehow he was still alive along with his goons.....even after the cutscene. The story missions are not showing on the map anymore and i am angry. Ive spent $80 on this game and believe i deserve a refund since i cant get in touch with a human being to help me with this problem. I reccomend this game if you want to get ♥♥♥♥ed by hanger 13

Driving feels really clunky i played the game to the bar in the tutorial sections all the models and graphics are subpar out side cutsecens.

TL;DR review  Pro&#39;s * Great artstyle * Mature 1960&#39;s setting * Shooting and melee combat feels very good * Badass main character * Great animations * Great voice acting  Con&#39;s * Cover system is dissapointing * Occasional hard crash * Awful AI * Repetitive gameplay after around 4 hours * Not much customization options * Story only interresting the first 2 to 3 hours * Performance not very good only getting 55 to 60 fps on unlimited framerate on a 980ti As a side note i think fps is locked at 60 even with the unlimited fps setting since 1080 and 980ti have exactly the same performance * The open world feels empty  Basicly i do not think it is worth the money at the moment, only the first few hours are interresting after that it is repetitive open world gameplay with barely any reward.

It started really nice..  The story is very good, the movies and animations are great! BUT:  It&#39;s horribly repetitive! It&#39;s alway the same pattern: 1. New city part 2. Talk with someone 3. Kill some groups of enemy boss 4. Boss comes out of his hole 5. Kill boss 6. Give control of city to partner 7. Repeat!  There are certain things that are damn annoying! Like: 1. It&#39;s not possible to shoot someone next to a tree.. the object hitboxes are catastrophic. They are at least 0.5m bigger than the object!  2. The cover system is horrible. Most time I only try to hide behind a certain object.. but the model has some other opinions..  3. I had to restart the game at least 100 times because of stuck missions (Game doesn&#39;t load animations). And other bugs like: after minimizing the game, mouse pointer keeps appearing.  But still.. the worst part in the end is the repetitive storyline..

Summary:  All this game is is the same mission a million times over, and then you get to one unique mission, then back to the same repetitive bullcrap until you get to the next unique mission, and the cycle repeats. Those unique missions are fun, just not worth getting to. Not worth $60.  Pros:  -Good Graphics -Good Driving Mechanics -Fun Combat -Top Notch Voice Acting and Motion Capture -Great Soundtrack -Vito Scaletta  Cons:  -WHY IN HELL IS THE CLASSIC TOMMY GUN DLC?!?!? -2k gave a great franchise in the hand of first time developers -Repetitive and boring -Season Pass -Not enough Vito -Lincoln is a ♥♥♥♥ -Cassandra is annoying -Terrible skybox  Conclusion:  I preordered this game as soon as I was able to being that I am a huge fan of the franchise, owning both Mafia and Mafia II. Mafia II is one of my favorite games of all time, so when I was able to buy this I went full Fry from Futurama and said &#39;Shut up and take my money!&#39;. Sadly I failed to realize that this was Hangar 13&#39;s first game, and as more and more gameplay was released I saw that the game might be repetitve. I didn&#39;t care, however, being the massive fanboy that I am and I preordered the deluxe edition. There is no way that this game is worth $60, so it sure as hell ain&#39;t worth $80. This game was a massive failure. Do yourself a favor and buy Mafia II. You&#39;ll get your money&#39;s worth from that masterpiece.

I don&#39;t normally right serious reviews but for this game I have to.   To start, this game really depends on the type of person you are. Im just going to give you my thoughts and opinon because thats what reviews really are.   That being said, I really like this game. In my 18 or so hours im not yet finished with it but I just can&#39;t listen to the negative reviews for a pretty good game. So heres my good thoughts - The characters and story are fantastic - The combat is brutal and fun - I admit there are a few graphical issues but all in all it looks good - The missions and I will elaborate later - THE SETTING AND SOUNDTRACK OH MY GOD - Weapons and cars are pretty neat - Playboy magazines - Vito Scalleta  Those are just a few of my good thoughts theres more like you can feed people to aligators. Now for some of the bad things - There are performance issues and no there is no more 30 fps lock so those salty nerds who probably couldnt get to 60 anyway should shut up - Depth of field issues that takes the games beauty away - The missons and again I will elaborate - The cars don&#39;t feel like the 60&#39;s  - Cassandra (I did not give any districts to her) rekt  There are more that I can&#39;t think of for both good and bad.   DO NOT COME INTO THIS GAME WITH MAFIA 2 EXPECTATIONS I FEEL THEY ARE 2 COMPLETLEY DIFFERENT GAMES AND AGAIN I WILL ELABORATE  To start the elaboration, the missons. MY honest opinion is its just ok. I do feel like im taking over a racket in a mob and it feels good. The objectives is probably what you would actually have to do to take down a major crime boss. Again it depends on the person, I loved the missions and doing all the different things to take down a racket and yes at times I did think it was getting repetitve but I still really enjoyed how you take these districts one by one and assign them to your sub bosses. Heres a roadmap of what you&#39;ll be doing in Mafia III - Talk to Donovan about the rackets - Talk to shmucks who know how to take down the rackets  - Kill enforcers, steal money, and basically tear apart the rackets and kill the leaders of them - The boss of the district comes to party - Stab him many times All in all, I think the missions are fine because they also all interwine with the story and the main goal.   Now time to elaborate on the other thing. DO NOT come into this game hoping its mafia 2 cause even I knew it wasnt going to be just because of what they had lincoln clay doing. You do not actually run a mafia or a mob your taking down one with former gang and mob bosses (Vito Scalleta).   So those are my thoughts. I could have deeply explained the story like a regular review but I was just tired of people crap on this pretty good game.  I would wait til a small price drop maybe to $40 dollars I would give the game about a 7.5/10 ish maybe 7 or 8 if these performance issues are fixed  Thanks for reading and I really hope this helped!  Love you, Derpy

Doesn&#39;t quite fell like the old Mafia games, &amp;amp; at it&#39;s release, it was missing a lot of the old small features from the older games, that i kinda missed. Like buying/changing clothes, tuning vehicles, etc.  They added that in later updates, but it still doesn&#39;t feel like the old Mafia games, though i&#39;m glad that they kept some of the old characters. The game itself, is pretty good, and still has a connection to the old Mafia games. So if you followed the Mafia series then i would recommend buying the game, and look into some of characters! ;)  And if you haven&#39;t played the old games, then don&#39;t worry. That is not important. You can definitely enjoy this game and it&#39;s story without having played the old ones, but you are gonna miss out on a lot of feelings that this game is gonna give you!

First: I got my money back! YAY!  To the game:  It&#39;s not worth a 1/10, that for it is a too good game.  Of course, I would also like to give it a 1/10, because it didn&#39;t fit with my expectations at all, but this game has very nice parts, like the cutscenes and the story.  Now, the problem is that Mafia III should have focus on the story instead of trying to be a &#39;GTA&#39;. Even if it then was more linear, I think the game would have been better.  Thinks they messed up:  - AI - Gunfights (unrealistic hit feeling) - Driving - Colisions and car damage - Particles - Repetitive gameplay after the story part (it&#39;s like AC and Far cry from the principe) - Bugs and crashes (many) - Releasing with 30 FPS lock (yepp, that was a MESS! In 2016 PC Masterrace plays @ 120 Hz)  Good:  + Story + Setting + Gangstahs + Cutscenes + Characters + Storytelling + Motion capturing and facial expressions  This is a solid game, but nothing for a real mafia fan.  I give it a 5 / 10... not more.

I have played Mafia I, Mafia II and i must say, Mafia III is far from being as good as its ancestors.  Not everything is bad though. Probably the storyline, the cutscenes and how the story is assembled is great i think. I really enjoyed it very much.  But the gameplay doesnt cut it. The whole game is soooo repetitive. They tried doing this GTA style, but it visible they dont know how to do it. the missions are all just the same and it becomes just a grind. And that just really kills the game.  To sum it up: as a Movie, great. As a game, trash.

I just want to try and keep the review short and simple whats right and what&#39;s wrong.  Right - Great music Fun new gameplay for Mafia  Voice acting was on point Portrayed the racism from back then maybe it overdid it but gave us an idea how things have changed from then and now Nice array of scenary from the swamps, to lower class living areas to mid class all the way to upper tier mansions etc Killing district bosses satisfying the missions to them are usually done quite well  The bad - Extremely repetitive by this I mean  Taking over districts never change they&#39;re always done in the same fashion i.e. Talk to one person this person will tell you a bunch of vague infromation and name the guy you&#39;re targetting after that you will get a bunch of side missions which pop up which will be the following Interregotation, freeing prisoners, killing the professionals in their orginisation then finally destroying their goods/contraband After you&#39;ve done the damage neccessary you will go back to the same person talk to him he tells you some more stuff about where the guy is which will be in a location you&#39;ve already likely shot up before sooo... back to the same place shoot everyone up and execute the boss, assign to one of the three underbosses Once that has all been completed you do it all over again ONCE more for the same district I ♥♥♥♥ you not you do the same thing over again and once you complete it a second time that is when you get to kill district boss. Then once the district boss is dead you fully assign the district to one of the three.  I knew I said I wouldn&#39;t make it long but I thought I had to describe that down so people would see how boring it is.  The other bad to the game is - Side missions are like taking over districts they&#39;re extremely repetitive as well No real customisation to vehicles No clothe stores instead wear the same thing for the whole playthrough Shops out in the open have no real use they&#39;re just there for nothing instead of holding playboy mags etc No complexity to owning districts Graphics are far from impressive Draw distance in the game isn&#39;t good Bugs galore all over the place you&#39;ll find weird happenings whilst playing Driving is debatable but I dislike it I feel like the car physics is awful and often found myself dreading having to drive which brings me to the next issue No fast travelling instead you have to travel from A to Z all by yourself very time consuming which would explain why the game lasted as long as it did for me Story was quite bland the one priest blabbing away about Lincoln in the present about Lincoln in the past but nobody really cares it jumps from present to past so often and I feel like they hurt their story by not keeping it in the past telling the story the way they did didn&#39;t improve anything it just made things confusing and jumped all over the place they could have easily jumped to a final clip of the priest in his present days at the end of the game that would have been the right touch to finish the story off instead of jumping from cutscenes willy nilly.  That;s all I can think of it was a big let down.  5/10 If I was to score it.

PROS:  Excellent hook in the beginning storyline Memorable Characters Sound track is amazing I only crashed twice so far    CONS: You never feel accomplished with missions Feeling &#39;empowered&#39; or leveling up is few and far between Day and night cycle is strange, I have artifacting everywhere AI is the worst I have seen Driving is a chore The best car you can unlock as delivery has this HIGH pitch whine to it. Makes it unbearable with the sound on. Imagine an electronic whine but at a very noticable level Car physics are strange, when you crash you never total. I&#39;ve flipped the car over 3 times and kept going in my intended direction The physical fighting is an absolute joke, spam one button to win Game feels way too easy, even on hard difficulty and AA turned off You die to random things all the time Having to restart quests at 7 different spots due to bugs City feels empty and everyone looks the same Pedestrians all say the same thing when you pass them. I had 4 guys say the exact same audio file when I passed by Collecting everything around the city is a job All the quests are the same thing after 2 hours of gameplay Skybox is terrible With a Mafia game I was expecting more brutal ways to kill people, not just the same knife stabbing or butt stroking (butt of the gun)  Verdict: Wait for a Steam Sale

SUMMARY After Mafia 2 this game comes after 6 years of difficult development. I must say I am very disapponted. The first 3 hours are really good, but after that you do the same damn stuff for like 30 hours, which gets boring really quick. I enjoyed few facts ( and few moments ) about the game, but it isn&#39;t enough for me to reccomend. Also pay attention to the horrible optimalization of the game.  59/100  PROS - really good radio soundtrack - almost all of the characters are well written, as well as the dialogues - the car models look very realistic and nice - I liked the way the cutscenes were made - the game continues the story the same way Mafia 2 continued Mafia&#39;s story - just through few details - Lincoln is not as ♥♥♥♥♥♥ generic character as it seemd from trailers  CONS - on my i5 2500 + gtx 970 the game ran at 50 fps at low details when not moving, it dropped to like 35 when driving - despite the how badly the game runs on most of PCs, the graphics look quite ugly and very blury - developers represent Mafia III as a story-based game, but after finishing I must say is has a very generic story and there aren&#39;t many plot twists - for about 30 hours you do the absolutly same thing over and over again, which gets boring after 5 hours ( so then you have 25 hours of boring gameplay ) - sometimes the game tries to a tell a serious story about war, racism and gangter families, but then you go and kill about 30 people in 5 minutes and nobody gives much ♥♥♥♥ about it which kills the serious feeling  - quite a lot of physical and visual bugs, crashes aren&#39;t rare at all - for some reason you can not save the game ( it only has autosaves ) and you can have only 1 game save at time  TIP If you really want to play it I would definitely reccomend buying after 6+ months ( so the developers fix various technical problems ) and in sale because the game in my opinion is not worth 50 euros.
compound: -0.9713, neg: 0.16, neu: 0.73, pos: 0.11, 
The new aspect of the game (taking rackets and making money that way) nowhere near makes up for its unappealing story and lack of diversity. I expected so much more from the game, seeing as you would now be your own boss but it fell flat. The game is worth 30€ in my opinion and I would not recommend that you get it for anything above that.

I like to consider myself an open world enthusiast. To me a good open world game should have concise and meaningful missions one after the other, with the occasional batch of side missions or a bunch of side activites to do when you don&#39;t feel like playing the story. This game however feels the need to make the player grind several repetitive missions before you get to the good story bits. Don&#39;t get me wrong, the way Hangar 13 did the story is amazing. I think the voice acting is great and the in game graphics during cutscenes are just awesome. But get the ♥♥♥♥ outta here if you expect me to destroy this, interrogate that, kill him a million ♥♥♥♥ing times BEFORE I get to enjoy your narrative.  Gameplay is fun but we need more mission variety! Also there&#39;s literally no customization of cars or your clothes. MAFIA 2 HAD THAT WTF. We need more things other than guns to spend money on. Not done with the game yet. There are things that will keep you in, such as the playboy magazines and especially the story. I&#39;ll keep playing, but whoever is thinking about buying it now: Don&#39;t. Wait until we see what the &#39;season pass&#39; has to offer first. They may add ♥♥♥♥ that will make this game worth it.

I have to say i&#39;m dissapointed to this game. The game is unfinished. The streets are very similiar almost anywhere you go. The game doesn&#39;t run well even with my geforce 1070 and it just lacks the feeling which I had in Mafia 2. Missions are also repetitive and it gets boring real quick. I had big hopes for this game and I bought it too fast, should have waited to see what others think and I must say, game that comes in 2016 shouldn&#39;t have this ♥♥♥♥♥♥ looking graphics. Don&#39;t buy this game, play mafia 2 instead. It is a masterpiece and it works.

I got a refund, and you should to.  Low res texture, upscaled 720p, 30fps cap, choppy animations, bad AI, bland modern UI that is ugly, generic gameplay, repetitive missions...  This game is a sad excuse for a triple A release in 2016. Only good thing about it are the cutscenes and excellent story/setting, with its top-notch voice acting. However, you might as well just watch Goodfellas or The Godfather movie instead of wasting $60 on this crap.

The most pisspoor excuse for a Mafia game, I absolutely loved Mafia I and II, but this is horrendous, barely even a Mafia game.  -Average story (which is generic and predictable) -Looks and runs horrible/y -No customization -No interactability with the world -Repetitive missions  The only thing that saves it is the shooting and music.

Alright, i&#39;ve spent little over 7hrs on Mafia III now, and well it took that long for the fanboy in me to go F*** this c*** I&#39;ve loved the Mafia franchise since the first (well apart from the racing in Mafia 1) but this i can&#39;t go along with.  So i wanna start with the good things, because there are some. The story and the way it&#39;s told is good. driving mechanics are fairly good (although the render distance with F*** you over a few times) City is a good size (gotta consider the small successes)  And then the bad things. I know not alot of good. Game is/was locked at 30FPS (Console port, FFS) Upscaled 720p textures, but you&#39;d never know, because they are so frggin blurred out. It&#39;s comical and sad at the same time.  Render distance is a joke.  Keymapping is a mess, &#39;E&#39; to open a door, &#39;F&#39; to enter a car. why not have &#39;F&#39; or &#39;E&#39; do it for both?!  The AI, ehm yeah. Walked up to a guard in a hostile zone he spots me, i duck behind cover and just wait for him to come to me, and i do a takedown and all is good. I&#39;m in a hostile zone, meaning restricted area, shoot on sight and that Sh**. oh on the note of AI, the police is worse than the gangsters/mobsters. Civilian just called in the police, i&#39;m making ready for a stand off, police arrives and just sits in the patrol car doesn&#39;t shoot or get out.  Mafia III in it&#39;s current state, worth 10Euro (maybe) Don&#39;t waste your money wait for them to fix their Sh**

DO NOT BUY THIS GAME! I really wanted to like this game but it&#39;s so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ boring. All the missions are the same and that&#39;s not an exageration. You will encounter glitches that can force you to restart the game all over again and it will exit itself out. After 18 hours I finally gave up and just looked up the ending.

Awful PC port. Pretty sure they never even tested the game on PC before they released it. Even after they unlocked the 30 fps lock and allowed up to 60 fps or more I&#39;m getting 52 fps in the game menu... the GAME MENU. I have a 980ti and i7-6700k 4.0ghz and I can run Witcher 3 on max graphics in 1440p at 60 fps. Also, the graphics have been downgraded from what they were showing in 2015. Do not reward these developers by buying this game.

I don&#39;t normally right serious reviews but for this game I have to.   To start, this game really depends on the type of person you are. Im just going to give you my thoughts and opinon because thats what reviews really are.   That being said, I really like this game. In my 18 or so hours im not yet finished with it but I just can&#39;t listen to the negative reviews for a pretty good game. So heres my good thoughts - The characters and story are fantastic - The combat is brutal and fun - I admit there are a few graphical issues but all in all it looks good - The missions and I will elaborate later - THE SETTING AND SOUNDTRACK OH MY GOD - Weapons and cars are pretty neat - Playboy magazines - Vito Scalleta  Those are just a few of my good thoughts theres more like you can feed people to aligators. Now for some of the bad things - There are performance issues and no there is no more 30 fps lock so those salty nerds who probably couldnt get to 60 anyway should shut up - Depth of field issues that takes the games beauty away - The missons and again I will elaborate - The cars don&#39;t feel like the 60&#39;s  - Cassandra (I did not give any districts to her) rekt  There are more that I can&#39;t think of for both good and bad.   DO NOT COME INTO THIS GAME WITH MAFIA 2 EXPECTATIONS I FEEL THEY ARE 2 COMPLETLEY DIFFERENT GAMES AND AGAIN I WILL ELABORATE  To start the elaboration, the missons. MY honest opinion is its just ok. I do feel like im taking over a racket in a mob and it feels good. The objectives is probably what you would actually have to do to take down a major crime boss. Again it depends on the person, I loved the missions and doing all the different things to take down a racket and yes at times I did think it was getting repetitve but I still really enjoyed how you take these districts one by one and assign them to your sub bosses. Heres a roadmap of what you&#39;ll be doing in Mafia III - Talk to Donovan about the rackets - Talk to shmucks who know how to take down the rackets  - Kill enforcers, steal money, and basically tear apart the rackets and kill the leaders of them - The boss of the district comes to party - Stab him many times All in all, I think the missions are fine because they also all interwine with the story and the main goal.   Now time to elaborate on the other thing. DO NOT come into this game hoping its mafia 2 cause even I knew it wasnt going to be just because of what they had lincoln clay doing. You do not actually run a mafia or a mob your taking down one with former gang and mob bosses (Vito Scalleta).   So those are my thoughts. I could have deeply explained the story like a regular review but I was just tired of people crap on this pretty good game.  I would wait til a small price drop maybe to $40 dollars I would give the game about a 7.5/10 ish maybe 7 or 8 if these performance issues are fixed  Thanks for reading and I really hope this helped!  Love you, Derpy

this game has still performance issues despite the update that is 5.8 gb. If this game&#39;s name was not mafia 3, 2k suffered a loss. People bought it because the early games of mafia series was brilliant. I will not trust 2k any more because of the mistakes that they have done in mafia 3. If you say that I have a significant gaming computer, there will be another problem for you while you play the game. MAFIA 3&#39;s performance repeats itself when you do some quests. AI is bad. Not terrible but still bad. AI can be fixed. I still play the mafia 3 although it has some problems. Because I love gangster&#39;s stories even though the story is not based by true events.   Finally; if you are obsessed about performences, I do not recommend you to buy it. If you love the gangsters, you might buy it. Have a nice day gamers....

First: I got my money back! YAY!  To the game:  It&#39;s not worth a 1/10, that for it is a too good game.  Of course, I would also like to give it a 1/10, because it didn&#39;t fit with my expectations at all, but this game has very nice parts, like the cutscenes and the story.  Now, the problem is that Mafia III should have focus on the story instead of trying to be a &#39;GTA&#39;. Even if it then was more linear, I think the game would have been better.  Thinks they messed up:  - AI - Gunfights (unrealistic hit feeling) - Driving - Colisions and car damage - Particles - Repetitive gameplay after the story part (it&#39;s like AC and Far cry from the principe) - Bugs and crashes (many) - Releasing with 30 FPS lock (yepp, that was a MESS! In 2016 PC Masterrace plays @ 120 Hz)  Good:  + Story + Setting + Gangstahs + Cutscenes + Characters + Storytelling + Motion capturing and facial expressions  This is a solid game, but nothing for a real mafia fan.  I give it a 5 / 10... not more.

I have played Mafia I, Mafia II and i must say, Mafia III is far from being as good as its ancestors.  Not everything is bad though. Probably the storyline, the cutscenes and how the story is assembled is great i think. I really enjoyed it very much.  But the gameplay doesnt cut it. The whole game is soooo repetitive. They tried doing this GTA style, but it visible they dont know how to do it. the missions are all just the same and it becomes just a grind. And that just really kills the game.  To sum it up: as a Movie, great. As a game, trash.

Nothing like the other Mafia series which was so good. In this third installment instead of climbing the ranks of the Mafia you are instead tearing down the mafia. Its like a really poorly done Godfather game. There is no enjoyment of the freeplay and the story is pretty tacky the entire time.

Doesn&#39;t quite fell like the old Mafia games, &amp;amp; at it&#39;s release, it was missing a lot of the old small features from the older games, that i kinda missed. Like buying/changing clothes, tuning vehicles, etc.  They added that in later updates, but it still doesn&#39;t feel like the old Mafia games, though i&#39;m glad that they kept some of the old characters. The game itself, is pretty good, and still has a connection to the old Mafia games. So if you followed the Mafia series then i would recommend buying the game, and look into some of characters! ;)  And if you haven&#39;t played the old games, then don&#39;t worry. That is not important. You can definitely enjoy this game and it&#39;s story without having played the old ones, but you are gonna miss out on a lot of feelings that this game is gonna give you!

Im not even complaining about the Graphics, i think they are okay...I think the jagged lines on the edge of everything is okay. I can play and enjoy a game with them.....However when an npc is 5 feet away and his face looks like two eyes and some hair is all i can see you know there is a problem....The game is way toooo blurry....It makes me sick playing....The blurryness is more of a problem than the 30fps issue. They say they are going to patch the fps...we will see... however i think the blurryness is an issue they need to address as well.....Food for thought i guess huh.....

i would say no for right now, i would not mind the 30 fps cap since they did say they would update it later. the problem is i run this game at all max settings at 1440p resolution and the game has horrible blurry textures. not even when im high on weed it lets me enjoy the game with this type or resolution. its like they just ported console textures to pc for a place holder until the patch comes. until a mod or patch with hd textures come out i cant really recommend it. it looks like a game that was released for ps3 right now. this review will change if they fix this issue

DO NOT BUY THIS GAME YET, WAIT FOR A PATCH  Horrible PC port, Locked at 30 FPS, low res textures in places, Visually It&#39;s not what you&#39;d expect from a Triple A title in 2016, Overall gameplay feels clunky, The shooting mechanics are poor and feel incredibly inacurate from mid to long range due to a reticule that doesn&#39;t focus to a fixed point, The standard driving controls make the car feel as though It&#39;s floating on the road (However It&#39;s much better if you switch to simulation mode in the options) The game has a fantastic sound track and the cutscenes for the most part are quite good HOWEVER the cutscenes are so long and there&#39;s so many of them that you spend more time watching the game than actually playing it. Just as the story started to get really interesting I encountered a loading screen that I couldn&#39;t get past, I left it loading for 15 minutes and nothing, At that point I decided it was time to try for a refund.  Pros - Interesting Story - Great Soundtrack - Some of the cutscenes are well done - Good Voice Acting - The Driving Controls Are Better In &#39;Simulation Mode&#39;  Cons - Ugly low res textures in many places on max graphics - Locked at 30FPS - No Windowed Borderless - Horrible Shooting Mechanics - Default Driving Controls Are Unrealistic And &#39;Floaty&#39;  - Cutscenes are way too long and there&#39;s too many of them - Game Crashes Frequently  My system specs - Nvidia 980TI GPU - Intel i7 4790k 4.7Ghz - 32GB Ram - Windows 10 (Can run most games 60fps max settings no issues)

+ Good story, great voice actors + Cool music  - Very linear - Extremely repetitive, most of the game you do the same four things over and over - Driving feels very arcade-y, and cars don&#39;t even deform when you crash - Some cars are impossible to drive, because they bug up and start bouncing - The AI is competely oblivious, making you practically invisible when sneaking - The AI also has no idea how to drive - Buggy, glitchy, poor performance - Everything that was good about Mafia 2 was taken out - For some reason you unlock the ability to steal cars silently -after- you get the ability to just order a better car to be delivered, free of charge - No customization - The map is huge, but mostly empty

Mafia III is an exercise in tedium.  The first couple of hours are decent, then the story grinds to a halt as the player is tasked with taking over different rackets and districts of the city. This makes up the large majority of the game, and involves you driving between repetitive, filler-tier activities that take less time to complete than it does to drive over to them.  It&#39;s a shame, because the handful of properly-designed missions that are in the game are fairly decent. The combat is pretty slick, the enemies have good hit reactions to gunfire, and the gunfights can be quite fast-paced with the mouse and keyboard controls. Most of the gunfights in the game will last about thirty seconds to a minute though, considering the repetitive racket-takeover missions make up most of the time.  The game has a fair number of bugs, too. A few times I&#39;d have to restart missions from a checkpoint because it bugged out and I couldn&#39;t progress. If you shoot and kill an enemy near a railing, they&#39;ll play an animation where they fall over the railing, but they&#39;d often freeze at the point where the canned animation was supposed to transition to ragdoll physics, so they&#39;d end up suspended in mid-air. If you have police chasing you and you call in the favour to get rid of the cops, they&#39;ll literally disappear right in front of you.  The optimisation is an issue, also. In my experience, they actually fixed the game up and had it running quite well through post-launch patches, but with the latest update (the one that introduces racing and car customisation), they seem to have reverted all of these optimisations and the game runs like crap again. You can&#39;t roll-back to previous builds through Steam either, so the only way to play the game with good performance now is to download a cracked version of the last build, which is absolutely ridiculous.  Overall, on the plus side - the game has a nice soundtrack and world; decent characters and acting; and good combat. On the other hand, there are only a few good missions hidden amongst 30 - 40 hours of absolute tedium; there are bugs; and the latest build screwed up the performance.  Would only recommend this if you can get it super cheap, and you&#39;re willing to accept the risk of possibly slipping in to a coma from mind-numbingly boring missions.

Tried to swim onto the riverbank, got stuck on an invisible wall.  This game is poorly made, and an insult to the Mafia line. I would not recommend you spend your money on this game. This is one of those games that you want to play but it&#39;s not worth the money. Mafia II was an incredible game, and anyone who has played that would obviously have high hopes for this.   Wait for a BIG sale for this game, or pirate it, because it&#39;s not worth anything more than $30.

I&#39;ve had this game since it unlocked on the release day. I was well aware of the 30fps cap 5 hour&#39;s before the game was due to unlock. This disappointed me a little bit but I still carried on playing. Now the fps cap has been lifted the game is smoother to play. I have a MSI 980 and I can get an average of 50 and sometime&#39;s higher fps. I cannot maintain a stable 60fps on my card. It seem&#39;s to run at 99% most of the time even if I were to turn the graphics preset to low. With the fps above 30 it just uses 99%. Hopefully this can be optimized more in the future.   Now down to the gameplay its self. I have been playing for over 14 hour&#39;s and I have enjoyed the game. The game play is pretty good, the combat I personally think is comfortable to play with. A little more manoeuvrable than what Mafia II was, even though I never had a problem with how Mafia II played out. There is plenty to do in the way of story and side mission&#39;s. Just like your average open world game. A lot of people complained about the graphics and texture&#39;s. I wouldn&#39;t say the game looked the best but it doesn&#39;t look horrible. To be honest if you can get into playing the game then you won&#39;t really dwell on it too much.   All in all I think it&#39;s a fun game to play. I hope that in the near future that the developer&#39;s might tweak and optimize the visual side of thing&#39;s, as that would just add to the grateness.

I have now completed the game and overall it was alright. It could have actually be great if developers made more focus on the main quest line and would bother to polish the PC port.  Lows: - You need to complete majority of side missions to progress with the story. - No hesists or robberies, just kill-kill-kill. - All side missions are nearly identical: confront (kill or interrogate) someone or destroy stuff. - You get good weapons way too early in the game, meaning you stick with them to the end. - Lock breaking mechanism is overly simplified. - Cannot skip pre-racket dialogues. - Cannot modify cars. - Police does not care of you speeding. - It rains way too often. - Night and day cycle is poorly performed - dawns and sunsets nearly blind you. - I have not experienced any crashes or major bugs, bu there were plenty of small lags for the game of this level. - Same price as GTA-5... that is about as much they have in common.   Highs: + You can actually play stealthy or go full Rembo in most of the missions. + Stealth gameplay is interesting, but nothing even remotely close to Hitman series. + Main story missions (once they get unlocked) are exciting and fun. + Good game if you want to have a casual session. + Main characters are thought through. + Music selection is good. + Cut scene visuals are good - characters actually use their facial muscles. + Clear ending: you are not left wondering of what happens next.

Well the game feels good. I have played all Mafia games and I have to admit they add up really well. Love the environment and character interaction. Good feel for the story feels like a real 60s 70s theme. However it doesn&#39;t live up to its expectations with performance. I have a really good PC and monitor the game feels rather choppy a bit rushed. Especially with the 30 fps lock in the beginning, It would be rather nice if they took there time and optimized it properly or do so in the future updates. Otherwise its worth the purchase!

I was excited to buy this game because I absolutely loved Mafia 2. I was somewhat dissapointed that Mafia 3 did not meet the standard of it&#39;s predecessor.   Here are a few things that I liked and disliked.   Liked: - The game is enjoyable to play (if you do not compare it to Mafia 2)  - The physics in this game are alright and the shooting part is quite good.   Disliked: - It didn&#39;t meet the Mafia 2 standard.  - General interaction with people is louzy - The missions do not vary and repeat themself - No rich backstory - Cops basically ignore everything - Too easy - District conquering system the same as Saints Row - Main character is missing a personality - I didn&#39;t see the mafia part - You can&#39;t use stores but only rob them - Can&#39;t switch clothing or upgrade your weapon much  In a nutshell, this game dissapointed me massivly.  I wouldn&#39;t recommend it.

great start to the game, but went downhill really quickly. taking out enemies involves the same set of moves (distract and then stab) and all sub-bosses so far are virtually the same. Didn&#39;t bother to complete the game it got so boring. shame really.

If you want a modern, scaled down version The Godfather (&#39;06) filled to the rim with bugs, very mentally challenged npc&#39;s and a single mission on repeat. Then this game is for you!  Speaking of npc&#39;s, &#39;Patroling&#39; cops, aka the 5 cops that are not stationary by the precinct are the worst of them all, they will literally only react if you point a gun at their face, or if you trigger a witness. So feel free to drive at 120mph on the sidewalk right past them, you got nothing to lose.  Also the &#39;attempt&#39; to create an intriguing story is laughable.  The best part of the game is the soundtrack, shame that it feels like they only have 10 different songs altogether over the 3 stations.

Well the game feels good. I have played all Mafia games and I have to admit they add up really well. Love the environment and character interaction. Good feel for the story feels like a real 60s 70s theme. However it doesn&#39;t live up to its expectations with performance. I have a really good PC and monitor the game feels rather choppy a bit rushed. Especially with the 30 fps lock in the beginning, It would be rather nice if they took there time and optimized it properly or do so in the future updates. Otherwise its worth the purchase!

I have now completed the game and overall it was alright. It could have actually be great if developers made more focus on the main quest line and would bother to polish the PC port.  Lows: - You need to complete majority of side missions to progress with the story. - No hesists or robberies, just kill-kill-kill. - All side missions are nearly identical: confront (kill or interrogate) someone or destroy stuff. - You get good weapons way too early in the game, meaning you stick with them to the end. - Lock breaking mechanism is overly simplified. - Cannot skip pre-racket dialogues. - Cannot modify cars. - Police does not care of you speeding. - It rains way too often. - Night and day cycle is poorly performed - dawns and sunsets nearly blind you. - I have not experienced any crashes or major bugs, bu there were plenty of small lags for the game of this level. - Same price as GTA-5... that is about as much they have in common.   Highs: + You can actually play stealthy or go full Rembo in most of the missions. + Stealth gameplay is interesting, but nothing even remotely close to Hitman series. + Main story missions (once they get unlocked) are exciting and fun. + Good game if you want to have a casual session. + Main characters are thought through. + Music selection is good. + Cut scene visuals are good - characters actually use their facial muscles. + Clear ending: you are not left wondering of what happens next.

I would love to actually be able to play this game.  Sitting with a GTX 970 + i5 6500 and can&#39;t reach 60 FPS on Medium settings.   Yet, I can play Dishonored 2 perfectly fine, Battlefield 1 perfectly fine. I&#39;d love to be able to play it if it works, as I loved the 2nd Mafia.

This game had the potential to be great, and they failed. Don&#39;t get me wrong it is a good game but it is not worth 60 bucks its probably worth half of that. If the devs continue to support the game and add some small things to it, it could become ten times better just with customization or other systems in the game that require your attention. Without those small personality things the game feels super repetative. Even thought GTA 5 is repetative you would have a mission where something unique happens, and that just isnt the case here. The soundtrack is ♥♥♥♥ing AWESOME though. Its essentially a gang killing simulator.   6/10
compound: 0.9385, neg: 0.091, neu: 0.718, pos: 0.191, 
In short: Just poorly made mix of GTA+Far Cry with almost identical side missions, boring repetative gameplay and without a single remarkable charismatic character.

Same complaint as with the first Assassin&#39;s Creed game, excellent concept ruined with the same mission over and over, it&#39;s repetetive and after driving clear across the map for the 20th time for a mission you&#39;ve completed 39 times it gets boring pretty fast. Cover based shooting too easy, stealth assassinations too easy. Might be worth buying on sale for the story.

 Verdict: You&#39;re having a laugh-ia III.   Just another open world check list objective game. Play for 2 hours and you&#39;ll realize the next forty or so will just be the same. -Interrogate someone then go to objective A and destroy/take/beat someone -Repeat on objective B -Kill a boss  Performance - I&#39;m getting about 60-80 FPS with everything maxed. That&#39;s on a GTX1080 and i7 4790k 16GB RAM. The game is visually pretty bland, the textures aren&#39;t very detailed and there&#39;s a blurry quality to the whole game. For my playtime the lighting was broken and outside scenes would slightly lighten and darken at random. GTAV looked a lot better and ran better too, this game needs some patchwork before it&#39;s recommended.

If this game came out under a different title i would recommend it. The fact that its so far away from even being close to the mafia 3 we all wanted it to be is what ruins it.  If you purchase this game not wanting a mafia game, but something totally different, then its a pretty decent game.   7/10 for overall rating 0/10 for mafia rating   RIP mafia series

Wow. was really excited to play this game...until i played it. It has repetative tasks, its as if there are only 5 major jobs to do throughout the whole game with story missions here and there. AI is terrible, Story was just O.K... I would save your money and not buy this garbage. Super let down by all the hype. Stay away, not worth it.

Not sure what to say, bit frustrated as it&#39;s crashed 3 times and lost my saves so have to go back to last mission - ok when it happens once, but 3 times is not fun.  Other than that the game seems good, nice graphics and sounds, the AI is a bit crap at times and when you have many enemies, thery showe up then they dont (when you do the scan mode)   I cannot recommend this game at the moment which is a shame as Mafia II was excellent :/   If they fix the crashes and AI then I will change my rating!  This feels like it was rushed out (like so many games these days)  A few days later and it&#39;s still crashing guys, and there is so many little bugs - see my screenshots - I have done many missions but the final objective is missing, its happened 3 times now  I have now asjed for help from 2K as the game shows things like objectives that are not yet ready to do, but the wording is still in the game, so you spend time looking for the object.  2K have responded and their reply is its my computers fault, and it maybe down to DirectX etc - laughable and useless reply!   I am still enjoying playing and the game is good, its just frustrating with the amount of bugs.  The music makes the game worth playing tbh, its got a great soundtrack on a few radio sdtations :)

My computer runs all new games just fine, but this game (tried different graphics settings) comes with ridiculous mini-stutters while driving. This really kills the experience. I am hoping for a patch to solve this ... but no dev should release a game in such a state.

I pre ordered this game (usually wouldn&#39;t do it, but I was a HUGE Mafia II fanatic), and have already put about 50 hours into it, and beat the story. I ran into a few small bugs in the start, but they were patched pretty quickly (control mapping was the main thing). Surprisingly it took me around 40 hours to get to the end of the game, as I played and enjoyed all the content the game had to offer through out. I can say a lot of the missions are a bit repetitive, as most of it follows the same formula, but I can assure you that they all have their own interesting twist, and are ultimatly still in my opinion a ton of fun, so I don&#39;t mind that I do a lot of the same for a lot of the game. However along with all the repetitive missions you do to take over districts, there are at least 15-20 totally unique cinematic missions (just like Mafia II, just surrounded by all the other missions too), and they are all ♥♥♥♥ing amazing. Overall, it was a really fun experiance and although a lot of it was the same, it was a good setup in my opinion, and I still got a lot of refreshing new missions anyways so it&#39;s all good.  As for the story, I honestly loved it too. Admittedly it might not of gone as deep as Mafia II&#39;s story did, there weren&#39;t a whole lot of twists, but there were a few... and they were pretty crazy, especially in the start of the game. After that though you basically do just successfully do what you set out to do, and do a pretty good job at it. It&#39;s all pretty satisfying and awesome, but I can admit that it would of been interesting to see more... different things happen. It&#39;s kinda hard to not think about the old Mafia II, where you even go to prison at some point, nothing like that here.  More in comparison to Mafia II as I&#39;m sure a lot of you thinking about this game may be thinking about, it does drop a lot of awesome features from Mafia II, one huge example being vehicle customization. From what I&#39;ve heard though, the developers have already promised free future DLC with vehicle customization and personal vehicles, so don&#39;t panic there. A lot of little small details have still been removed though, things like opening the trunk/hood of any car (pointless but neat), fixing the engine on vehicles after you crash, the vehicle damage working a little better in my opinion, stores you can actually buy things at, different apartments you live at, tons of things like that... but there are a ton of commonly overlooked things in this game people seem to miss. The world doesn&#39;t feel quite as dead, I mean it&#39;s not crazy lively after you beat the game but, still better than Mafia II where the most exciting thing you can see happen on the streets is someone slipping on the ice. In this game it at least feels a little more alive. There are also details like picking up any body you want (for whatever reasons you may have...), people get out of cars when you aim at them (in Mafia II they didn&#39;t even react), idle animations in cars and animations for shifting the gear in cars, corpses actually stay, you won&#39;t really see them just fading away into nothing. Sure there are things missing, but a lot of neat things were also added, and not just to the open world, but also to the story, it&#39;s a lot more interactive now and you get choices with what you want to do.  Now with performance issues and bugs... are there any? From what I&#39;ve read yes, but from what I&#39;ve experianced, not really at all. The only real bug I encountered was the control remapping, but as I mentioned that was patched. The game performs pretty well for me with a GTX 970 and a i7-4790k, I can either run at max settings and get a solid 30fps, or lower just reflection and anti aliasing a little and get a solid 60fps. You&#39;ll probably hear a lot of people saying the game runs like crap, but if you turn a few settings down, it&#39;s not that hard to run at all. It&#39;s real smooth in my opinion, just a few settings are pretty demanding I guess (but the game doesn&#39;t even look that different with them low, most things can be kept high anyways). I played the whole game with hardly any bugs and only 2 crashes, both before the first update. Not at all saying what other people say are not true, but just saying for me I haven&#39;t experianced any of it, it&#39;s been really enjoyable.  I&#39;ve never posted a review before, but I thought I really should share what I have to say about this game because it really pains me to see all the negative feedback it is getting, I understand some of it, but the game really doesn&#39;t deserve it all because it still is a really fun title and overall in my opinion worth every bit of it. It lasted a long time (and I&#39;m still about to go play more now), and was a ton of fun through out. I simply encourage everyone thinking about picking this up to be skeptical, read the negative reviews and be careful, but don&#39;t forget to look at what a great game this is once you get past the few problems it may currently have.

Oh boy Mafia 3 is coming out im so excited it will be so good, trailers look good, first gameplays look amazing, AAA game what could go wrong. Well ♥♥♥♥ this game is the most repetitive boring game I have ever played. We play the same ♥♥♥♥ing mission from beginning to end in slightly new or sometimes even the same places. It is just not fun, the games only savior is the cutscenes and story which is awesome until your twenty hours in and realize why the ♥♥♥♥ am i still playing. All i want is the story to be over so i can stop playing. Another fun point is the shooting and sometimes the graphics. They look good and killing is awesome. But it is just so ♥♥♥♥ing boring i cant explain this to you anymore it is just sooooo ♥♥♥♥ing boring, the only time i would recomend buying this kill simulator is for 15 dollars, that is when it isnt on sale. ♥♥♥♥ you hanger 13 and ♥♥♥♥ you 2k for ruining one of my favorite franchises.

The game crashed within the first 30 minutes of gameplay, which is horrible for a AAA game like this, it should not have happened in the first place, not to mention that the game lock the frame rate at 30 fps, I thought game developers are well-acknowleged that they shouldn&#39;t lock fps on the pc, this happened in the past as well and act like this pisses a lot of people off. Finally the control is all over the place(I play the game with controller for better experience since mouse and keyboard on this game is horrible), the button placement is not optimized for most people and it takes a long time to get use to. 6/10. Expected more from a game hyped for so long, gotta not recommend this game until everything get patched.

I don&#39;t reccomend this game at all and here&#39;s why:    The first two hours of the game is basically a tutorial teaching you how it works and the first full mission, so by the time you realize you don&#39;t want the game anymore it&#39;s too late to get a refund    If you like the first full mission then your gonna like this game just as much because the whole thing is a copy and paste of that mission    There&#39;s nothing extra like changing clothes, haircut, etc. so you can&#39;t do anything other than copy paste missions    I couldn&#39;t continue playing because I had to see what else there is to the game so after doing some research I found that it&#39;s the same thing 36 times (thanks to angry joe doing the math)    Even if there weren&#39;t the uncountable amount of bugs in this game it still doesn&#39;t feel finished     Even bigger of a disappointment than watch dogs because at least watch dogs had some variety in the things you can do and at the least different colored outfits    There is absolutely nothing other than guns and ammo to spend your money on, making money almost worthless since there isn&#39;t anything actually cool to buy    But you don&#39;t actually even have to buy weapons as every mission I have played has been beat using weapons I find on the ground  I&#39;m ♥♥♥♥♥♥ that I&#39;m unable to get a refund because by the time I realized that this game was ♥♥♥♥ and actually hurts to play through because of how repetetive it gets, it was already 9 hours because like I said earlier the first two hours isn&#39;t an accurate representation of how the game really is. I had more fun in the tutorial than in the real game, but even looking past the dullness of this game you still get a buggy, unfinished, early access game. The positives of this game are that:    It looks pretty good    The first mission is strong    The story was good (until you start getting tired of the game and feel no motivation to continue)  I honestly can&#39;t think of any other positives that I would include in this game. EDIT: I ALSO HAVE NO BIAS AS I HAVE NEVER PLAYED PREVIOUS MAFIA GAMES

I&#39;m gonna go simple. Top four cons a lot of people agree with:  1.) 30 FPS cap. It&#39;s been fixed now so the complaining should stop, 30, 60, unlimited FPS enabled. Don&#39;t forget to go into your settings and change it. 2.) Lackluster graphics. People say it&#39;s blurry and low res textures, overall I can&#39;t complain. 3.) Crashing. It happens, mostly after cutscenes for myself. 4.) Gameplay can be repetitive. Go here kill him, go there, interrogate him, destroy that.  Top 4 pros in my opinion:  1.) Good gunplay. Satisfiying to clear a room with just about any gun. 2.) Good animations. Shoot someone in the gut and they&#39;ll fall over in pain, clutching their stomach. Just looks smooth. 3.) Interesting story. Comes off as a simple revenge type deal but there seems to be more to it and the characters themselves, pretty awesome. 4.) Awesome soundtrack.   Hope you enjoyed or found my crap review useful.

Mafia III…where to begin…  Let’s begin with Mafia and Mafia II…both great games.   Mafia was a masterpiece of storytelling and world creation…atmosphere and player involvement. It was different. It was Mafia!  Mafia II was pretty darned good…hard to follow such a striking first game but did pretty well IMO; equally good story telling, characters and setting. Thoroughly enjoyable and immersive! Who can forget driving a drunken Joe and Eddie home from burying a corpse with Dean singing Return to Me on the radio and everyone singing along!  If I had a complaint with Mafia II it was that such a great world was pretty sterile off the beaten track…could have done with more to do…more interaction…more hidden missions if you entered a shop or abandoned building…just a bit more imagination in creating a bit more non linear entertainment. Lots of people commented this.   So!... easy peasy lemon squeezy right? Mafia 3… you set it in Vegas in the 60s or something like that…continue the great Mafia theme… the guns, the fast cars, the loose women, the story driven immersive gameplay and add a bit more non-linear content a bit more exploration. You maintain the car customization, the choice of clothes…the music… you add….you add a bit more…you make a classic…  Well, no…you hand the franchise off and say “kill it!”  The devs cut all the customization…all the clothes…any hope of exploration. You create a huge sterile world and fill it with…dun dun dun! A quest for fuses! You cut the Mafia down to supporting actor…you make the star… racism!…yeah! Political correctness front and bloody centre…YAWN! If I see one more review praising this dirge for “tackling issues” I’m gonna puke. It doesn’t even work at doing this by the way. The eponymous hero of our PC tale is only half AA and runs around being handled by a white guy and ends up well entrenched in just the sort of stereotypical lifestyle that you’d have aspirations to avoid coming from a minority background.  The point is you don’t make a Mafia game about something other than the Mafia! It’s not big…it’s not clever it’s not surprising…it’s just pants!  No real story telling here either…Cut scenes are not story telling! Cut scenes are not a substitute for gameplay! If it needs narration then it has failed to tell the story...this is true of all cinema and all gameplay. In Mafia and Mafia II…you were the story…you were the evolution…you lived it you played it. Here you watch the story as it’s handed out to you and then you play the gaps…terrible!  OMG! The repetition! I have finished the game and I can honestly say it’s 50 hours of rinse and repeat the same couple of missions over and over and over and over and…  Even the Playboy collection is repeated in good part from Mafia II…the same girls!! Did they think we wouldn’t notice?!!  Graphics are hardly better than Mafia II!…textures are from ages past. I’m a firm believer in story first and graphics later. I could forgive the view in the rear view mirror if I was living the Mafia life…but it just appals when you aren’t…   I won’t even go near the 30fps cap at launch…I can’t… I choke up and want to eviscerate my console buying friends…  Couple of patches later and things have improved somewhat…but even a Titan X (Maxwell) clocked at 1400MHz just runs 60fps at 1440p max settings….could this be the new Crysis…just without the visuals or story?  In summary…this would have been a good 20 hour game if it was called “bored on the bayou”.  Good points?...I guess the music is still good and some of the gunplay reminds you of Mafia.  Who does this to a game? How does this happen? It’s so obvious how this should have moved forward it’s hard not to wonder at the mental acuity of Hangar 13 or the lack of s**ts given at 2K over the legacy of the first two chapters of this series…  *Sigh*  Buy on sale when it’s seriously fallen in price…

Very very poor performing game! I am so sick of AAA titles being reliesed in this sort of state. I had waited for the patch so that I could run at a more acceptable frame rate nut now I cant even get 15fps!!  I am running on a GTX 970 SLI configuration and have tried disabling one of the cards but no difference.  I was so looking forward to this game but now....its not worth the hard drive space!   Gutted.  I purchased Mafia 3 via a steam code purchased from a store. This means I cannot get a refund!

This game is grabage! This isn&#39;t even a video game, its a movie! Ten minutes of cut-scenes, followed by 2 minutes of gameplay, rinse and repeat. I have played... Watched this game/movie for 1.2 hours now and I have spend the better hour watching cut-scenes and 20 mins playing the game.   The story is also terrible! It starts of with loads of people talking about this guy linkin clay, then after 15 minutes of cut-scenes, I am then suddenly driving a truck to a bank. I am then robbing the bank then suddenly, I&#39;m driving a guy to a bar to get drunk, I then wake up, feed the homeless, then I&#39;m shooting poor people who live in a swamp. Seriously, this game jumps from one scene to another, like a 12 year old child who has A.D.D. The rest of them clearly seperates black people from white people, it tries to make a statment that white people are evil. Yet all I see in the game is black people commiting crime in a white suburban area, black people killing people of all colours and nationalities, but somehow white people are bad because they use the &#39;N&#39; word, even though black people are murdering and killing countless people. Double standard, social justice warrior crap to the MAX!  Gamplay is bad. 30 FPS is horrible, its like a blurry GTA game, were your car feels like a supercharged hotrod, with the stopping power of a mac truck hauling a ton of goods. The AI is also bad. In some instances the AI won&#39;t respond even when they spot you, while at other times they will spot you through a wall. The rest of the game is very blurry over all and very hard to see where you are going unless its night time.   I wouldn&#39;t buy this trash heep of a game. Its that one in the series that destoryed the rest of the series, like what Terminator 3 did to T1 and T2. Save your money, forget this game.

!!!SOME MINOR SPOILERS ALERT!!!  Well, this is how it starts: Lincoln Clay returns from Vietnam, gets back to his family. He helps his father (not real one) to deal with his problems, kills some Haitians, robs a bank for local mafia boss. Then mafia boss kills Lincoln&#39;s father and (brother?) with hands of your heist crew members. All these missions are great, you feel that Mafia atmosphere around, lots of details, really good cutscenes and acting. You feel attached to characters. This is great intro, not cliche bullsh*t with revenge for characters you met 5 minutes ago and dont even remember their names. You play this intro for hour or so, but then you realise this was just an intro to the actual game, and the game itself should be even better, right?  Actual game turns out to be cheap grinding openworld sh*t. I realised that when i captured 3rd district in town, and my actions were all the same: 1. You come to guy who can help you to capture district. 2. He tells you where to find a snitch, who you can interrogate. 3. Snitch tells you locations of places you can hit to damage property of local district boss. 4. You come to this places and kill everyone/destroy something. (By the way, interrogation missions are the same as this step). 5. Repeat step 4 until boss of the property comes out, and kill him. Yeah, and boss comes out in a same place you have trashed already, so you have to trash it again. I did 3 districts, no exceptions for that. And yes, you do this step same way as step 4 again.  So after 3 districts I have 6 more to go and I realised that the game is already boring and repetitive. I still dont understand how from these beautiful intro missions game instantly turned into grinding piece of sh*t. You basically do one mission with little variations over and over again and even story missions between this district grinding (which are killings of the district bosses) are pretty much the same.   I knew, that the game will be openworlded, and I know what to expect from this kind of games. I like Shadow of Mordor and Batman: Arkham Something series, and i thought Mafia 3 will be same solid openworld expirience, where you do same things but it is not boring because realization of game mechanics is really good.  Game mechanics in Mafia 3 are not good. The game has dumbest AI I saw in years. Stealth mechanics are pure trash (thanks a lot to AI). You can run around stealthy in crowded place, killing guards one by one scaring the f*ck out of civilians, yet their screams and panic will not alert nearby guards at all. To kill everyone stealthy you need only 2 buttons: D-Pad Left (whistle) and B (takedown). You stand behind cover luring brainless enemies right in your hands and kill them without any trouble. Shooting in this game feels good, but AI is still dumb so they like to leave cover and run to their deaths. I&#39;ve been playing on Hard difficulty, and i had problems in shootouts only when there were really a lot of enemies. They run to you from different directions, throw molotovs and can kill you in 3-4 hits on Hard, but if their number is less than 6, they are doomed. And yes, I play with a gamepad, so if you play with KB&amp;amp;M you can multiply this number by 10.  And few words about graphics. Lets compare it to GTA. Mafia always had better graphics than GTA of same (+-2) release year. It looked really mature in comparison with &#39;casual&#39; and not serious GTA. Mafia had a lot of highly detailed interiors, &#39;movie-like&#39; characters and animation. Mafia 3 looks... meh. Nice enough, but meh. GTA 5 that released 2.5 years ago still looks way better, more detailed and has more fps on max settings (I have i5-3570K, GTX 1070, 16 GB RAM and 2560x1440p monitor). The only graphics part that feels like real step forward is cutscenes. They were great in previous Mafias but in this one they are even better. And you&#39;ve probably seen videos like Mafia 3 vs Mafia 1 where you see how every little detail that worked in Mafia 1 doesnt exist in Mafia 3, so I will not talk about it in detail.  So, my final rating is 5/10. If you remove title Mafia 3 and Vito from the game you will not find anything remotely close to previous Mafia games. I will continue playing and if by some miracle game will return to missions like in intro, I will be really happy. But I doubt this will happen, and it would be really frustrating anyway to dig through this sh*t missions to play some golden ones. And sorry for my bad english, btw.

The first two Mafia games were anomalous in that they provided totally open worlds, but really didn’t give you anything to do in them apart from drive around in between story missions. The large environments served more as window dressing, a trick to immerse players and ground them in the setting and shoes of the protagonist. The sequel Mafia 2 was criticized for this empty open world, and either as a result of this or for other reasons entirely, the third game has abandoned this format for a more conventional modern one. The result is a very mixed bag with some soaring strong points and unfortunate, tedious lows that make it difficult to answer the simple question of whether this is a good game or a bad one.    continue reading   [www.newgamenetwork.com]   as an aside, i&#39;ll say I didn&#39;t post this on Steam right away because I was torn on whether or not to recommend it. Since i&#39;ve played it, the story and themes have stayed with me more than I expected, and I think this game is worth playing for the story, just be prepared for some tedium. A good one to get during a sale and to play during a time without many releases

I bought the game Friday &amp;amp; today (sunday) I decided to give it a go. What a farce the first thing I noticed was that as the game launches the backlighting on my keyboard &amp;amp; mouse turns off. I plugged in my orbweaver after 20 minutes fapping round rebooting and that time the keyboard lights went off but the orby and the backlights on my mouse stayed on. I never had this hassle with any other game before. Anyway after I got into the game for a bit the keyboard lit up in some weird color but better than notheing so I disconnected orby. Keyboard lights work intermittently altho mouse lights now seem OK. Then got into a loop in the tutorial whereby map opened then when that closed went bak to tutorial screen again no way out back &amp;amp; forward btween the screens but no game. Eventually fixed that by connecting up 360 controller - again after much fapping around. Then I got about 15 minutes of gaming (most of which was watching cutscenes - yuk) before big crash to desktop during firefight. What? restart n go thru it all again. This game should never have been shipped in this alpha state there are just too many bugs in it. I played all mafia games (1&amp;amp;2) with KB &amp;amp; M plus all GTA plus the great &#39;sleeping dogs&#39;, none of them required musical controllers which breaks immersion and makes the game a drag.

It was terible, refunded it.  AI behaved like a 1980&#39;s game when attacking you, basically just stood there till i killed them.  Graphics are poor for 2016, story and cut scenes are bloody great but again the gameplay is wank. I had 6 enemies coming at me, i used 6 bullets to headshot everyone of them, I just stood there taking my time, they just stood there shooting ala wolfenstien 1980&#39;s style, being hit didnt even move my aim point or make my character flinch. Utter balls, game felt like it was make for incompetent gamers.  Truth is its a GTA wannabe and fails miserably, Mafia will never be GTA, it was never meant to be GTA, STOP TRYING TO MAKE IT GTA!!

Do not reccommend this game at all.  The 30fps cap, while being patched, should not have been in the game upon release. That&#39;s just telling us they&#39;re rushing out an unfinished product. On top of that the combat just feels completely bland. Its no different than what you&#39;d find out of any mediocre 3rd person shooter and lacks any real complexity.  Comparing this to Mafia 2, they did everything wrong right from the start. The start should have been Lincoln in Vietnam as a tutorial (similar to Vito in WW2 in Mafia 2). Instead you just get a boring drive to a ~30 second shootout.  I had good expectations for this game coming from Mafia 2, but its just very disappointing to me.

Pros: - Will write it once the game is actually playable.  Cons: - 30 FPS lock. What year is this? - Lack of Steam controller support. The game is completely unplayable with a Steam controller since the controller presets are not loaded for some reason, you&#39;ll have to bind everything to keyboard buttons. Walking around with the stick and setting the setting the right touchpad to Mouse also won&#39;t work, since the character will stop walking every time you move the camera. Same goes for aiming with right trigger and mouse.  In hindsight, it has taught me an important lesson: Do not ever preorder. Ever. &#39;But it&#39;s a major title and it can&#39;t go wrong!&#39; Nope, it still can.

yaya blah blah, i just played a couple of minutes BUT no, just no!  don&#39;t buy this game at the actual state.  it&#39;s another lazy ♥♥♥ console port - the keybindings r a joke. u can&#39;t change the language after starting a new game, so decide well. (erm, ma bad, u can. just go to default settings in the audio tab and than u can change it) stupid anyway.   some ppl say the 30 fps lock is not that bad - it is THAT bad! it&#39;s not a dark world full of crime - it is a blurry world full of blur to hide the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ textures. if u wanna laugh, look at the textures the game is offering. im sure this should have been a xbox 360 game years ago. don&#39;t get me wrong, graphics r not everything and the game looks okey, but why the heck does it run like a big pile of ♥♥♥♥?!   maybe this is the new scheme to develop games now days, or maybe pc gamers are just not worth it to get a playable FULL PRICE game...  look at starbreeze, or klei for example - dev teams with just a handfull of ppl, but they give us awesome games! games made with love.  anyway, i can&#39;t play mafia 3 at this state and im ashamed to support these lazy punks with their ♥♥♥ full of money, alot of ppl and what we r getting? ♥♥♥♥  update: 2 crashes after 1 hour and at the same place.  u want to know some positives about the game? alright; storytelling seems to be really good so far and also the game mechanics feel well done.   i really hope the game is enjoyable after the upcomming patch, cause mafia 3 seems to have a good amount of potential.

At its current state I cannot recommend it. 30 fps as told from developers the day before launch 2016 is an absolute disgrace. Sloppy menus, not much settings, and hard to configure due to bugs. Crashes, in game bugs. Story? I dont know. After barely 25min my mind was sickened from the &#39;lagging&#39; experience of 30 fps. Whiny? Yes. The mediocre resolution I can deal with, the 30 fps not. Patch in the weekend some say that fixes 30fps. Too little too late I say. Should have been included from the start. Yet another game not finished at launch. Refunded for me. Unfortunately...

Slow in the head developers launch PC title with a 30fps cap and expect a good Steam review. *SIGH* Then they release condescending statement about taking their PC players seriously. Like they didnt have enough time to sort this ♥♥♥♥ out before release. Well played 2k, well played.

Had problems before I even started, black screen and game did not start.  After 45 min playing with 30 fps and crap lag the game crashes!

 https://youtu.be/Vs51T0raPIc   Game:  Mafia III  Genre:  Open World Crime  Developer:  Hangar 13  Publisher:  2K   Copy supplied by Steam     Mafia III  is an open world crime game developed by Hangar 13 and published by 2K. As a huge fan of the previous two games (yes, even   City of Lost Heaven  ), I was very excited for the third installment. While it is not bad, it could have been a lot better.   STORY

1. 30fps locked 2. Everything is blurry except Lincon himself 3. Game randomly crashes  Seriously? I just bought Mafia 2 for the last few weekends and felt quite disappointed about it. And now this?

Can&#39;t get past the tutorial level. Found it wierd that I couldn&#39;t &#39;melee&#39; the first tied up person I found and I couldn&#39;t pick up the body of the other &#39;whacked&#39; guard when the game just starts.   I figured it was meant to be like that so you were force to actually continue playing the game/story instead of fooling around.  Stuck at the furnace. Can&#39;t preform a &#39;silent takedown&#39; because for some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ reason my controls don&#39;t work. Binding them to custom keys or going back to &#39;vanilla&#39; settings... it doesn&#39;t matter. Can&#39;t whack the guard.  Not even when plugging in a controller. And I understand that Dualshock 4 controllers might not be fully supported but I&#39;m using software make it work. It works with every other (newly) released game at launch apart this one. Can&#39;t see the keybindings and not a single button on my controller does the &#39;silent takedown&#39;.  And let&#39;s not forget the things this game does horribly wrong: rather limited graphical options. Only being able to turn off/or on the &#39;blur&#39;. A little bit wouldn&#39;t mind but putting it on means having completely washed out graphics. FPS locked to 30 and I already notice how terrible it is having to play this on a locked 30 FPS. Specifically chose the PC version because of the previous games being on PC and just having the most &#39;freedom&#39; to run and tweak the game to your preferences.  Fix the damn game. I&#39;m pretty sure I&#39;d enjoy this if I could properly play it.  1/10 terrible launch 2K/Hangar 13. It seems like you didn&#39;t even bother testing.

I Do NOT recommend Mafia 3 !!  They removed so many good functions of mafia 2 !  Why no unique car upgrades ? Why lifetime weapons ? No unique missions after the intro ! Feels like always the same ! So repetitiv..-.- Didnt got any speeding ticket jet. after i passed cops with over 90mph ! Car Damagemodels suck ! No refueling the car ! No washing the car ! Nothing is customizable ! Cant change clothes. ! YOU Only kill .. damge.. and conquer the city... so dumb ♥♥♥♥... DONT BUY !!  The game could be way better with just a little bit of polishing and changing some stuff...  and the worst ...  Crashes without any error messages.... and fps were locked to 30 at relese !!   I´m so dissapointed....:(

It&#39;s a shame the frame lock is causing so much controversy. For me, 30fps is not enough to take away from how great this game is.   Voice acting and soundtrack are on point as usual for the Mafia series.  Despite the weapon combat mechanic being a lil clunky, the sound design and animations have been impressive so far, along with the realistic facial structures of the characters, you&#39;d beleive they were genuine citesens.  Anyway, when you take into account the recent flood of borderline scam releases, theres no way this game deserves so many negative ratings over a temporary frame lock.

thats my second view of this game, and still disappointed about this ♥♥♥♥ing game. The frame rate was unlocked. However gtx970 cant even stable at 60 fps for medium graphic setting, wtf??? and even the graphic looks like ♥♥♥♥?? I can play GTAV for high graphic stable at 60 fps, and those graphic much better than this game. Omg, thats the most unfrendly optimisation geme in this year. i rather playing mafia 2 instead... ::((( (sorry my bad eng)  Furthermore, Maifa 3 has 16.7G for audio file, 10G for CG, so it only has less than 15G for actual gaming content?? well done 2K:)

Starts of with a decent story, great music, great cutscene graphics - but falls completly flat on its stomach after a few hours.  * It&#39;s repetitive as ♥♥♥♥ (36 times the same mission) * The story goes from intresting to unrelatable psycho masskilling in no time. * AI is generally ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, blind and not up to the task * Aiming with 2-handed weapons, is way off. (no, really) * The same in-game animations are used, over and again. * Badly optimized - can hardly get over 30 fps with 2x970 SLI * Speaking of 30 fps.. That FPS lock at launch was ♥♥♥♥ing unacceptable!   The game had potential, it really did. It even starts out great, you really feel pumped - but when the first hour is through, you start to see the cracks in the painting - the repetitiveness, the random cutscene stories from people you never meet or have any relations to, the people you genuinly cared about are gone - and left are some uninteresting charachters and plothole that grows gets deeper by the minute.  I&#39;ll show myself out, i just wish i could have asked for a refund and not supported this mess.

Soundtrack is good, story is ok, graphics are very glitchy and it tends to crash a lot for some users, and really awful AI (You can kill 30 npc&#39;s and not one thing is done, Hell, you can use cars and bodies to stop a whole city dead in it&#39;s tracks! lol).  Also has a message about racism, NI &amp;amp; Prod hatred and some issues with communism it appears... go figure... apart from all that it can be fun, be it very short fun. (If you don&#39;t crash out to desktop, or get bored repeating the same type of missions over &amp;amp; over).  Characters are very forgettable and the world isn&#39;t interactable in any way, you can shoot bottles off tables etc. but you can&#39;t use a phone, WC, radio, eat, drink, change clothes, fix/modify cars etc.  4/10 - Music 2, Story 2.   Buy it next Easter on the Steam sale for £5, it sure isn&#39;t worth the £40 I paid.

Following a doctors appointment and having my glasses checked by my optician i can only conclude there is nothing wrong with either my sight or my glasses. Therefore i can only conclude that the game looks like s***. I did some settings tweaking and upscaled the rendering, but this only helped a little. The game still looks blurry and the textures look like they received a photoshop smudging treatment. The combat felt stale and un-immersive. I drove on normal and simulated, but this also felt a little off. Before buying this game i did read up on it, after serverely lowering my expectations i was still left unsatisfied. If you want to play a good Mafia game, with good graphics, go buy Mafia II.

This game has a great story and a great depiction of the 1960s that being said the game feels empty outside of the main story it feels like there is a lot of the imersive features that are missing from mafia 2 ( fuel consumption , garage customization , being able to purchase goods and services, fast travel ) alot of what made mafia 2 so fun to play.  there are also graphic issues at times textures look muddy and are not at all what you expect from a AAA title made in 2016 the sky and clouds often looking liek it was from a retextured n64 art style.   despite all that i do enjoy the story but often felt myself pulled out of the immersion of the game due to the repetativeness of objectives or quests and repetative combat style with the Ai and main character.

Not recommended.  Poorly optimisied. Very blurry and stutters constantly.   Save your money and buy something. Don&#39;t just take my word for it, look at the thousands of other negative reviews.  Its shocking at this day and age a gaming company can get away with releasing something of this standard.  Massively disappointed as I really enjoyed Mafia 1 &amp;amp; 2.

I got this 2 hours before the fps and control patch came through. I didnt so much find the 30fps terrible but with unlimited fps it is far superior. I enjoy the games look quite a bit and have no complaints with the overall fidelity of the graphics, they work and often I find myself really just taking my time and enjoying my surroundings.  The car mechanics work for me as well, they have weight and slide and its all very actiony and I like that.  Gun play also has weight and its satisfying to watch arms fly back when hit or someone crumple into a bag of flesh when hit in the midsection with a shotgun.   Ive only unlocked 2 rackets so far but I also enjoy this as well, theres some repitition here but theres a fair bit of fluff story to go along with each one and its satisfying to take down the enemies in this.  The music is really great, alot of fantastic songs I grew up listening to as a child are well used here and tie into the story in a great way, really hitting that nostalgia factor.   The overall story and presentation is really great, alot of likable characters and excellent voice acting.  Do i recommend this game, yes, is it for everyone, no.  If you can enjoy driving around a city and taking in the sights, satisfying gunplay and the grind to unlock rackets then ya get this game- there is a fair amount of satisfaction in alot of what you do and unlike alot of open world games it all makes sense, your expanding your territory in your mission.

As is I can Not recommend this game to anyone. The fact that i can&#39;t keep any kind of steady framerate with my Gtx 970 and i5 4690 even on low settings is embarassing. The game does not have the kind of graphics to need such a powerful pc I can play most games on full settings at 1080p but this game isn&#39;t possible to play on full settings unless you have a 20 core processor and a Titan X and even then it probably wouldn&#39;t get a steady framerate. Overall the game is an endless loop of the same mission but I can forgive that because the story and gameplay is actually quite fun the stealth works but the AI is totally stupid making it a little too easy.. I would really like to play this game all the way through but in it&#39;s current state i&#39;m afraid i can&#39;t without severe frustration and agonizing slowdowns I&#39;d say it equivelant to playing a poorly emulated ps2 game  TO 2K or HANGER 13 : OPTIMIZE THIS GAME  Revision - Got the game running stable thanks to a very helpful post that i can&#39;t find now but it was basically going into my nvidia control panel and changing the antrioscopic filtering to 8x works good now def playable

-repetitive gameplay (maybe 5 out of the several dozen missions aren&#39;t) game literally feels like a proof of concept, really tired of these &#39;speed bump&#39; grind open world games and miss the good ol&#39; days of linear action/adventure based PC titles. -No difficulty progression, the end is just about as hard as the beginning, the funny thing is that the hardest part of the game is the random generated events when Marcano&#39;s hitman try to get you. If you are going to make a game that has grinding as a element at least make it so I am grinding towards being able to finish the story, not becoming more invincible. -dumb AI that is most effectively dealt with playing the game stealth, setting the game harder doesn&#39;t help, a hail of gunfire from a covered enemy will take you down to the brink of death just making the game more frustrating. Also can AI see through walls? -muddy sub-HD upscaled graphics similar to Quantum Break. -pop in/dithering of objects and textures. -shouldn&#39;t take GTX 1080 to run this game smoothly, no effort put into the PC version, feels like a straight port from the Xbox one with remapped controls. -crashing into everything, even bushes, same exagerated crash animation even at low speed. -cant even get out of water at shore. -100 some songs but only 3 radio stations, I feel like I hear the same 3 advertisements and songs over and over again. -poor GPS navigation and a hundred other random small bugs that definately don&#39;t belong in a triple A title. -developer provided a 60fps patch pretty quick but were really late to inform everyone about this red flag which would of cancled my pre-order, therefore you get a negative review.  +pretty decent story even though its kind of ridiculous and preachy at times, if you are playing this seriosuly just skip every side mission and just get to the objective as soon as possible you&#39;re not missing anything. +loot that is actually interesting, playboy and vargas tasteful nudes.

The Game does not run very well, consistently low FPS (under 30) on a machine that can run other, more demanding games above 60 no problem. Screen tearing is a very slight issue. Performance when on foot isnt too bad but when driving it is awful. Twice the game has crashed from looking back whilst driving at speed.  In terms of mechanics, the driving to me feels worse than Mafia 2, feels more like driving a boat than a car, very swimmy, lots of roll on the cars, lots of wheelspin, braking is ineffective and vehicles just seem to lurch about. Gunplay has been improved, weapons feel heavier and there is more variety and now upgradability to them. However unlike in Mafia 2 you are limited to only 2 at a time, a primary and a sidearm.  My biggest gripe with the game is the lack of veriety in the missions, it&#39;s the same thing over and over again until you take control of an area of the city, then you just go and take over another area. It feels like a grind. Compare this to Mafia 2 where every mission was different. Yes, some were better than others but they all had something unique and memorable about them. If I ever get round to finishing Mafia 3 I don&#39;t see myself ever wanting to go back and do it again, but I still play Mafia 2 to this day.  On the plus side, the soundtrack is very good.

I have a really nice RIG and I can only run this game on low settings smoothly.. This game is poorly optimized.. I can run GTA 5 on ULTRA with no real issue at all and this game.. not even close.  As for the game its fun and the story is there. Great characters, environment, music and gameplay but I see how the game  is repetative.   My specs.  Geforce GTX 970 driver version 373.06 Intel i7-6700k Skylake 4.00 GHz 31.91 RAM 2560x1440 59Hz ASUS Maximus Hero 8 SSD  If this game gets optimized better then I will give it a positive review.
